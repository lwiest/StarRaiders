; I wrote this document out of my own curiosity. When STAR RAIDERS was released
; in 1979 it became the killer app for the Atari 8-bit Home Computer System.
; Since then I have always been wondering what made it tick and how its (at that
; time) spectacular 3D graphics worked, especially the rotating star field.
; Impressed by "The Atari BASIC Source Book" I decided to reverse-engineer the
; STAR RAIDERS 8KB ROM cartridge to recreate a fully documented assembly
; language source code file. I had no access to the original source code, so the
; only way to succeed was a combination of educated guesses, trial-and-error,
; and patience. Eventually, I made it.
;
; Essential in preparing this document were three programs I wrote:
;
; (1) A 6502-cross-assembler based on the syntax of the MAC/65 assembler for the
;     Atari 8-bit Home Computer System to create the binary file that I verified
;     against the binary of the original ROM cartridge.
;
; (2) A text formatter to layout the source code file with its copious comment
;     sections. This was a big time saver, because as the documentation grew the
;     source code had to be reformatted over and over again.
;
; (3) A symbol checker to verify that the ubiquitous symbol-value pairs in the
;     documentation match the corresponding symbol values produced by the
;     assembler.
;
; This assembly language source code file is compatible with the MAC/65
; assembler for the Atari 8-bit Home Computer System. I was able to assemble it
; on an emulated Atari running MAC/65, producing the identical binary of the ROM
; cartridge.

;     value compute the two's-complement of <hexNum>. See also "ON POSITION
;     VECTORS".
;     Example: The starbase is -($1000) (or -4096) <KM> behind our starship.

; ON POSITION VECTORS
;
; The program uses a 3D coordinate system with the position of our starship at
; its center and the following coordinate axes:
;
; o   The x-axis points to the right.
; o   The y-axis points up.
; o   The z-axis points in flight direction.
;
; By the way, this is called a "left-handed" coordinate system.
;
; The locations of all space objects (Zylon ships, meteors, photon torpedoes,
; starbase, transfer vessel, Hyperwarp Target Marker, stars, and explosion
; fragments) are described by a "position vector".
;
; A "position vector" is composed of an x, y, and z component. The values of the
; position vector components are called the x, y, and z "coordinates". They have
; the arbitrary unit <KM>.
;
; Each coordinate is a signed 17-bit integer number, which fits into 3 bytes:
;
;     Sign     Mantissa
;          B16 B15...B8 B7....B0
;            | |      | |      |
;     0000000* ******** ********
;
; o   B16 contains the sign bit. Used values are:
;       1 -> Positive sign
;       0 -> Negative sign
; o   B15..0 contain the coordinate value (or "mantissa") as a two's-complement
;     integer number.
;
; The range of a position vector component is -65536..+65535 <KM>.

;
; INFO: The x and y coordinates of space objects are converted and displayed by
; the THETA and PHI readouts of the Control Panel Display in "gradons". The

;
;
; ON VELOCITY VECTORS
;
; The velocities of all space objects are described by a "velocity vector". The
; velocity vector is relative to our starship.
;
; A "velocity vector" is composed of an x, y, and z component. The values of the
; velocity vector components are called the x, y, and z "velocities". They have
; the arbitrary unit <KM/H>.
;
; Each velocity vector component is an 8-bit integer number, which fits into 1
; byte:

;     |
;     |B6...B0 Mantissa
;     ||     |
;     ********
;
; o   B7 contains the sign bit. Used values are:
;     0 -> Positive sign, movement along the positive coordinate axis
;          (x-velocity: right, y-velocity: up, z-velocity: in flight direction)
;     1 -> Negative sign, movement along the negative coordinate axis
;          (x-velocity: left, y-velocity: down, z-velocity: in reverse flight
;          direction)
; o   B6..B0 contain the velocity value (or "mantissa"). It is an unsigned
;     number.
;
; The range of a velocity vector component is -127..+127 <KM/H>.
;
; Examples:
;
;     01111111 = +127 <KM/H>
;     00010000 =  +16 <KM/H>
;     00001111 =  +15 <KM/H>

; DESCRIPTION
;
; Initializes the program, then continues into the game loop at GAMELOOP
; ($A1F3).
;
; There are four entry points to initialization:
;
; (1)  INITCOLD ($A14A) is entered at initial cartridge startup (cold start).
;      This initializes POKEY, resets the idle counter, sets the mission level
;      to NOVICE mission, and clears the function key code. POKEY is enabled to
;      receive keyboard input. Code execution continues into INITSELECT ($A15A)
;      below.
;
; (2)  INITSELECT ($A15A) is entered from GAMELOOP ($A1F3) after the SELECT
;      function key has been pressed. This loads the title phrase offset for the
;      copyright notice. Code execution continues into INITDEMO ($A15C) below. 
;
; (3)  INITDEMO ($A15C) is entered when the program switches into demo mode.
;      This loads the demo mode flag. Code execution continues into INITSTART
;      ($A15E) below.
;
; (4)  INITSTART ($A15E) is entered from GAMELOOP ($A1F3) after the START
;      function key has been pressed. This enqueues the new title phrase and
;      enables or disables demo mode, depending on the preloaded value.
;
; Initialization continues with the following steps: 
;
; (1)  Clear the custom chip registers and zero-page program variables from
;      ISVBISYNC ($0067) on.
;
;      NOTE: Because of loop jamming there is a loop index overshoot. Instead of
;      clearing memory at addresses $0067..$00FB, the memory at addresses
;      $0067..$0166 is cleared. This does no harm because $0100..$0166 is a yet
;      unused part of the 6502 CPU stack.
;
;      NOTE: At address $A175 a hack is necessary in the source code to fake a
;      STA ISVBISYNC,X instruction with a 16-bit address. ISVBISYNC ($0067) is a
;      zero-page address and regular assemblers would translate STA ISVBISYNC,X
;      into the byte sequence $95 $67, not $9D $67 $00. This indicates that the
;      original ROM was maybe created using a special assembler, perhaps a
;      cross-assembler.  
;
; (2)  Initialize the 6502 CPU (reset the stack pointer, disable decimal mode).
;
; (3)  Clear program memory from $0200..$1FFF in subroutine CLRMEM ($AE0F).
;
; (4)  Set the address vectors of the IRQ, VBI, and DLI handlers.
;
; (5)  Enable input from Joystick 0.
;
; (6)  Enable Player/Missile graphics, providing a fifth PLAYER.
;
;      BUG (at $A1A6): The set PLAYER-PLAYFIELD priority arranges PLAYERs in
;      front of the PLAYFIELD. This makes sense as space objects represented by
;      PLAYERs (for example, Zylon ships, photon torpedoes, and meteors) move in
;      front of the stars, which are part of the PLAYFIELD. However, PLAYERs
;      also move in front of the cross hairs, which are also part of the
;      PLAYFIELD. Suggested fix: None, technically not possible.
;
; (7)  Do more initialization in subroutine INITIALIZE ($B3BA).
;
; (8)  Set display to Front view.
;
; (9)  Show or hide the Control Panel Display (bottom text window) in subroutine
;      MODDLST ($ADF1), depending on the demo mode flag.
;
; (10) Initialize our starship's velocity equivalent to speed key '6'.
;
; (11) Enable the Display List.
;
; (12) Initialize the number of space objects to 16 (5 PLAYER space objects + 12
;      PLAYFIELD space objects (stars)).
;
; (13) Set the title phrase to the selected mission level in subroutine SETTITLE
;      ($B223).
;
; (14) Enable the IRQ, DLI, and VBI interrupts.
;
; Code execution continues into the game loop at GAMELOOP ($A1F3).

; DESCRIPTION
;
; The game loop is the main part of the program. It is basically an infinite
; loop that collects input, computes the game state, and updates the display. It
; executes the following steps:
;
; (1)  Synchronize the start of the game loop with the vertical blank phase of
;      the TV beam, which flagged by the Vertical Blank Interrupt handler
;      VBIHNDLR ($A6D1). This prevents screen flicker while the PLAYFIELD is
;      redrawn at the begin of the game loop, because during the vertical blank
;      phase the TV beam is turned off and nothing is rendered on the TV
;      display. 
;
; (2)  Erase all PLAYFIELD space objects (stars, explosion fragments) from the
;      PLAYFIELD that were drawn in the previous game loop iteration.
;
; (3)  Draw the updated PLAYFIELD space objects (stars, explosion fragments)
;      into the PLAYFIELD (skip this if in hyperspace).
;
; (4)  If the idle counter has reached its trigger value then clear the center
;      of the PLAYFIELD, an 8 x 2 pixel rectangle with a top-left position at
;      pixel column number 76 and pixel row number 49 (?).
;
; (5)  Clear all PLAYER shapes.
;
; (6)  Update the vertical position of all PLAYERs and update all PLAYER shapes.
;
; (7)  Update the horizontal position of all PLAYERs.
;
; (8)  Rotate the position vector of all space objects horizontally and
;      vertically, according to the saved joystick position (skip this if in
;      Galactic Chart view) using subroutine ROTATE ($B69B).
;
; (9)  Move our starship forward in space. Our starship is always located at the
;      center of the program's 3D coordinate system, so all space objects are
;      moved along the z-axis toward our starship by subtracting a displacement
;      from their z-coordinate. The amount of the displacement depends on our
;      starship's velocity.
;
;      BUG (at $A3C1): This operation is not applied to Photon torpedoes (?).
;      Suggested fix: Remove LDA PL0SHAPTYPE,X and BEQ SKIP011. 
;
; (10) Add the proper velocity vector of all space objects to their position
;      vector (except for stars, which do not have any proper motion).
;
;      BUG (at $A419): The correct maximum loop index is NUMSPCOBJ.ALL*3 = 147
;      instead of 144. Suggested fix: Replace CMP #144 with CMP #147.
;
; (11) Correct the position vector components (coordinates) of all PLAYER space
;      objects if they have over- or underflowed during the calculations of the
;      previous steps.
;
; (12) Calculate the perspective projection of the position vectors of all space
;      objects and from that their pixel row and column number (applies to Front
;      and Aft view) using subroutines PROJECTION ($AA21), SCREENCOLUMN ($B6FB),
;      and SCREENROW ($B71E). If a space object (star, explosion fragment) moved
;      offscreen then a new space object is automatically created in subroutine
;      SCREENCOLUMN ($B6FB).
;
; (13) Handle hyperwarp marker selection in the Galactic Chart view in
;      subroutine SELECTWARP ($B162).
;
; (14) If in Long-Range Scan view, compute the pixel column number and the pixel
;      row number of all PLAYFIELD space objects (stars, explosion fragments) on
;      the plane established by the z and x axis of the 3D coordinate system
;      using subroutines SCREENCOLUMN ($B6FB) and SCREENROW ($B71E). Our
;      starship's shape is drawn using subroutine DRAWLINES ($A76F). If the
;      Long-Range Scan is OK then PLAYFIELD space object pixel numbers are
;      computed and drawn. This is skipped if the Long-Range Scan is destroyed. 
;
; (15) Update all PLAYER shapes, heights, and colors (see detailed description
;      below).
;
; (16) Flash a red alert when leaving hyperspace into a sector containing Zylon
;      ships by setting appropriate colors to PLAYFIELD2 and BACKGROUND.
;
; (17) Update the color of all PLAYFIELD space objects (stars, explosion
;      fragments). The color calculation is similar to that of the PLAYER color
;      calculation in (15). It also computes a range index and uses the same
;      color lookup table FOURCOLORPIXEL ($BA90). If a star in the Aft view
;      became too distant (z-coordinate < -$F000 (-4096) <KM>) its position is
;      re-initialized in subroutine INITPOSVEC ($B764).
;
; (18) If in demo mode skip input handling and jump directly to function key
;      handling (28).
;
; (19) Handle keyboard input in subroutine KEYBOARD ($AFFE).
;
; (20) Handle joystick input. Store the current joystick directions in JOYSTICKX
;      ($C8) and JOYSTICKY ($C9).
;
; (21) Check if our starship's photon torpedoes have hit a target in subroutine
;      COLLISION ($AF3D). This subroutine triggers a game over if all Zylon
;      ships have been destroyed.
;
; (22) Handle the joystick trigger in subroutine TRIGGER ($AE29).
;
; (23) Handle the Attack Computer and Tracking Computer. If the Attack Computer
;      is neither destroyed nor switched off then execute the following steps:
;
;      o   Update the Attack Computer Display's blip and lock-on markers in
;          subroutine UPDATTCOMP ($A7BF) (if in Front view).
;
;      o   Update the tracking index of the currently tracked PLAYER space
;          object. If a Zylon ship is tracked, then make sure to always track
;          the Zylon ship that launched the last Zylon photon torpedo. If this
;          Zylon ship is not alive then track the other Zylon ship - if alive.
;
;      o   If the Tracking Computer is on then switch to the view that shows the
;          tracked PLAYER space object by emulating pressing the 'F' (Front
;          view) or 'A' (Aft view) key (only if in Front or Aft view).
;
; (24) Handle docking at a starbase in subroutine DOCKING ($ACE6).
;
; (25) Handle maneuvering both of our starship's photon torpedoes, the single
;      Zylon photon torpedo, and the attacking Zylon ships in subroutine
;      MANEUVER ($AA79). This subroutine also automatically creates meteors and
;      new Zylon ships.
;
; (26) Check if our starship was hit by a Zylon photon torpedo (skip this if in
;      a starbase sector): Its x, y, and z coordinates must be within a range of
;      -($0100)..+$00FF (-256..+255) <KM> of our starship.
;
; (27) If our starship was hit then execute the following steps:

;*** (15) Update PLAYER shapes, heights, and colors ****************************

; DESCRIPTION
;
; In a loop over all PLAYERs, the following steps are executed:
;
; o   Clear the PLAYER shape offset and height.
;
; o   If in Galactic Chart view or in Long-Range Scan view, preload a random
;     color and a magic z-coordinate (distance value) for PLAYER3..4
;     (representing hyperwarp markers in Galactic Chart view and blips in the
;     Long-Range Scan view, like, for example, Zylon ships, meteors - or even
;     the Hyperwarp Target Marker during hyperwarp!).
;
; o   If in Front or Aft view, execute the following steps:
;
;      o   Skip dead PLAYERs.
;
;      o   Preload the distance value for the remaining live PLAYERs.
;
;      o   If we are in a starbase sector, combine PLAYER0..2 into a three-part
;          starbase shape. Compute the pixel column numbers and pixel row
;          numbers of PLAYER0..1 such that they are arranged left (PLAYER0) and
;          right (PLAYER1) of PLAYER2. In addition, preload a color mask, a
;          counter actually, that will make the starbase pulsate in brightness.
;
;     BUG (at $A512): The code at $A512 that skips the combination operation for
;     PLAYER2..4 jumps for PLAYER3..4 to SKIP025 at $A52A instead of SKIP026 at
;     $A52E. Thus it stores a color mask which does not only make the starbase
;     PLAYER0..2 pulsate in brightness but also PLAYER3..4 in a starbase sector,
;     for example the transfer vessel, photon torpedoes, etc. - or even the
;     Hyperwarp Target Marker when hyperwarping out of such a sector! Suggested
;     fix: None, code hard to untwist.
;
; o   After storing the color mask, check if the PLAYER shape is still above the
;     bottom edge of the PLAYFIELD.
;
;     BUG (at $A534): The test checks the vertical position of the top edge of
;     the PLAYER against the bottom edge of the PLAYFIELD above the Console
;     Panel Display (= Player/Missile pixel row number 204). This is not
;     completely accurate as the Console Panel Display starts at PM pixel row
;     number 208. For example, if you carefully navigate a starbase to the
;     bottom edge of the PLAYFIELD, at a certain point the center of the
;     starbase shape bleeds over the bottom edge of the PLAYFIELD (while
;     sometimes even losing its left and right wings!). Suggested fix: None, as
;     a more elaborate test may consume too many bytes of the cartridge ROM
;     memory in order to fix a rarely noticed visual glitch.
;
; o   Convert the preloaded distance value of a PLAYER space object closer than
;     $2000 (8192) <KM> into a range index of 0..15. PLAYER space objects more
;     distant than $2000 (8192) <KM> are skipped and not displayed.
;
;     Later, this range index will pick not only the correct brightness for the
;     PLAYER (the closer the space object the brighter its PLAYER) but also the
;     correct PLAYER shape cell and height (the closer the space object the
;     larger the PLAYER shape and height). 
;
; o   Update the PLAYER's shape offset and height. On the way to the shape
;     offset and height add the PLAYER's shape type to the range index and
;     divide it by 2 to arrive at the shape offset index and height index (the
;     same value). Use this index to pick the correct shape data and shape
;     heights from a set of shape cells and their corresponding heights, stored
;     in tables PLSHAPOFFTAB ($BE2F) and PLSHPHEIGHTTAB ($BE7F), respectively.
;
;     Remember that magic distance value used in the Galactic Chart and
;     Long-Range Scan view? Its value of $F2 is actually part of a negative
;     z-coordinate which is inverted to $0D00, leading to a range index of 13,
;     which, after the division by 2, picks shape cell 6. Shape cell 6 (the
;     seventh shape cell) of all space objects (except the starbase) is the
;     Long-Range Scan blip's dot (see PLSHAPOFFTAB ($BE2F) and PLSHPHEIGHTTAB
;     ($BE7F)).
;
; o   Update the PLAYER's color/brightness by picking the appropriate values
;     with the range index from lookup tables PLSHAPCOLORTAB ($BFD1) and
;     PLSHAPBRITTAB ($BFDB). Apply some special effects to the color/brightness
;     of certain PLAYERs, such as using random colors for Zylon basestars, or
;     using the precomputed pulsating brightness value for a starbase.

; DESCRIPTION
;
; This subroutine is executed during the Vertical Blank Interrupt (VBI) when the
; TV beam has reached the bottom-right corner of the TV screen and is switched
; off to return to the top-left position. This situation is called the "vertical
; blank phase".
;
; This subroutine signals its execution with flag ISVBISYNC ($67) (which is
; examined by GAMELOOP ($A1F3) to synchronize the execution of the game loop
; with the start of this subroutine). Then it switches the character set to the
; ROM character set, sets the BACKGROUND color depending on the severity of a
; Zylon photon torpedo hit and view mode, copies PLAYER and PLAYFIELD color
; registers to their corresponding hardware registers, clears the Player/Missile
; collision registers, calls the sound effects code in subroutine SOUND ($B2AB),
; and increments the idle counter. If the idle counter reaches the value $8000
; the title phrase is cleared and the program is switched to demo mode.
;
; BUG (at $A6EC): Because the values of SHIPVIEW ($D0) are $00, $01, $40, and
; $80, a value of 3 overspecifies the comparison. Suggested fix: Replace CMP #3
; with CMP #2, which may make the code clearer.
;
; BUG (at $A712): Demo mode is entered via a JMP instruction, which proceeds
; directly into GAMELOOP ($A1F3). Thus code execution never returns to pop the
; registers pushed on the stack during entry of this subroutine. Suggested fix:
; None.

; DESCRIPTION
;
; This subroutine is executed during the Display List Interrupt (DLI). It
; switches the character set to the ROM character set if the DLI occurs at ANTIC
; line 96 (video line 192), otherwise to the custom character set. The former
; happens in the Galactic Chart view where the ROM character set is used in the
; Galactic Chart Panel Display.
;
; Then, the DLI PLAYFIELD colors are copied to the corresponding hardware
; registers and the values of the collision hardware registers for PLAYER3..4
; (our starship's photon torpedoes) are copied to the corresponding zero-page
; variables PL3HIT ($82) and PL4HIT ($83).

; DESCRIPTION
;
; Draws the Attack Computer Display (in Front view), cross hairs (in Front and
; Aft view), and our starship's shape (in Long-Range Scan view) on the PLAYFIELD
; (if the Attack Computer is not destroyed) by being passed an offset to table
; DRAWLINESTAB ($BAF9). This table consists of a list of 3-byte elements,
; terminated by an end marker byte ($FE). Each such element defines a single
; horizontal or vertical line, and is passed via memory addresses DIRLEN ($A4),
; PENROW ($A5), and PENCOLUMN ($A6) to subroutine DRAWLINE ($A782), which
; executes the actual drawing. See subroutine DRAWLINE ($A782) and table
; DRAWLINESTAB ($BAF9) for a description of the 3-byte elements. 
;
; With every call of this subroutine the blip cycle counter is initialized to
; the start of the DELAY phase (see subroutine UPDATTCOMP ($A7BF)).
;
; NOTE: The entry to this subroutine is in mid-code, not at the beginning.

; DESCRIPTION
;
; Draws a single horizontal or vertical transparent line.
;
; There are two entries to this subroutine:
;
; (1)  DRAWLINE ($A782) is entered from subroutine DRAWLINES ($A76F) to draw a
;      line in COLOR1.
;
; (2)  DRAWLINE2 ($A784) is entered from subroutine UPDATTCOMP ($A7BF) to draw
;      the blip in COLOR2 in the Attack Computer Display.
;
; The position, direction, and length of the line is defined by three bytes
; passed in memory addresses DIRLEN ($A4), PENROW ($A5), and PENCOLUMN ($A6). 
;
; A drawing operation draws one transparent line. It uses both the color
; register number of the overwritten (old) and the overwriting (new) pixel to
; decide on the new pixel color register number. This results in a transparent
; drawing effect. See the table below for all resulting combinations of color
; registers.

;
; For example, COLOR1 overwritten by COLOR2 yields COLOR3. If you look closely
; at the blip (in COLOR2) on the Attack Computer Display (in COLOR1) the lines
; of the Attack Computer Display shine through (in COLOR3) where they overlap.

; DESCRIPTION
;
; Draws the blip of the tracked space object and the lock-on markers into the
; Attack Computer Display. The actual drawing follows a cycle of 11 game loop
; iterations (numbered by this subroutine as "blip cycles" 0..10), which can be
; divided into three phases:
;
; (1)  Blip cycle 0..4: Draw blip shape row-by-row
;
;      Draw the blip's shape into the Attack Computer Display, one row each blip
;      cycle. After 5 blip cycles the blip shape is complete and completely
;      visible because between blip cycles, that is, game loop iterations, the
;      PLAYFIELD is not erased (only the PLAYFIELD space objects are). Drawing
;      is executed by branching to entry DRAWLINE2 ($A784) of subroutine
;      DRAWLINE ($A782). The blip shape is retrieved from table BLIPSHAPTAB
;      ($BF6E).
;
; (2)  Blip cycle 5..9: Delay
;
;      Delay the execution of blip cycle 10.
;
; (3)  Blip cycle 10: Update Attack Computer Display
;
;      After verifying that the tracked space object is alive, calculate the
;      blip's relative top-left pixel column and row number. Resulting values
;      are in -11..11 and -6..4, relative to the blip's top-left reference
;      position at pixel column number 131 and pixel row number 77,
;      respectively. 
;
;      Filter the Attack Computer Display area: Only pixels of COLOR1 within the
;      inner frame area (a 28 pixel wide x 15 pixel high rectangle with its
;      top-left corner at pixel column number 120 and pixel row number 71) pass
;      the filter operation. This effectively erases the blip.
;
;      If the blip is within -2..+2 pixels off its horizontal reference position
;      (pixel column numbers 129..132) then the tracked space object is in x
;      lock-on. Draw the x lock-on marker. 
;
;      If the tracked space object is in x lock-on and the blip is within -2..+1
;      pixels off its vertical reference position (pixel column numbers 75..78)
;      then the tracked space object is in x and y lock-on. Draw also the y
;      lock-on marker. 
;
;      If the tracked space object is in x and y lock-on and the tracked space
;      object's z-coordinate < +3072 (+$0C**) <KM> then the tracked space object
;      is in x, y and z lock-on. Draw also the z lock-on marker. 
;
;      If the tracked space object is in x, y, and z lock-on (and thus in
;      optimal firing range) set the ISINLOCKON ($A3) flag.
;
;      The following sketches show the Attack Computer Display area overlaid
;      with the Attack Computer Display frame:

; DESCRIPTION
;
; Handles the hyperwarp sequence, which transports our starship from one sector
; to another. It can be divided into four phases:
;
; (1)  ACCELERATION PHASE
;
;      The ACCELERATION PHASE is entered after the hyperwarp sequence has been
;      engaged in subroutine KEYBOARD ($AFFE) by pressing the 'H' key. The
;      Hyperwarp Target Marker appears and our starship begins to accelerate.
;      When our starship's velocity reaches 128 <KM/H> (the VELOCITY readout of
;      the Control Panel Display displays "50"), the STAR TRAIL phase is
;      entered. 
;
;      The Hyperwarp Target Marker is represented by a space object some fixed
;      distance away in front of our starship as PLAYER3. It has a lifetime of
;      144 game loop iterations and is tracked. Thus, tracking handling in
;      subroutine UPDATTCOMP ($A7BF) provides drawing the x and y lock-on
;      markers in the Attack Computer Display when the Hyperwarp Target Marker
;      is centered. 
;
;      A temporary arrival location on the Galactic Chart was saved when the
;      hyperwarp was engaged in subroutine KEYBOARD ($AFFE). During the
;      ACCELERATION PHASE (and the subsequent STAR TRAIL PHASE) this location is
;      constantly updated depending on how much the Hyperwarp Target Marker
;      veers off its center position.
;
;      The actual arrival hyperwarp marker row and column numbers on the
;      Galactic Chart are the sum of the temporary arrival hyperwarp marker row
;      and column numbers stored when engaging the hyperwarp in subroutine
;      KEYBOARD ($AFFE) and the number of Player/Missile (PM) pixels which the
;      Hyperwarp Target Marker is off-center vertically and horizontally,
;      respectively, at the end of the STAR TRAIL PHASE.
;
;      NOTE: The used vertical center value of 119 PM pixels is the PM pixel row
;      number of the top edge of the centered Hyperwarp Target Marker (from top
;      to bottom: 8 PM pixels to the start of Display List + 16 PM pixels blank
;      lines + 100 PM pixels to the vertical PLAYFIELD center - 5 PM pixels
;      relative offset of the Hyperwarp Target Marker's shape center to the
;      shape's top edge = 119 PM pixels). Recall also that PLAYERs at
;      single-line resolution have PM pixels that are half as high as they are
;      wide.
;
;      NOTE: The used horizontal center value of 125 PM pixels is the PM pixel
;      row number of the left edge of the centered Hyperwarp Target Marker (from
;      left to right: 127 PM pixels to the PLAYFIELD center - 3 PM pixels
;      relative offset of the Hyperwarp Target Marker's shape center to the
;      shape's left edge = 125 PM pixels).
;
;      If during the ACCELERATION PHASE (and the subsequent STAR TRAIL PHASE)
;      you switch the Front view to another view, the Hyperwarp Target Marker
;      changes to a random position which results in arriving at a random
;      destination sector.
;
;      During the ACCELERATION PHASE (and the subsequent STAR TRAIL PHASE) in
;      all but NOVICE missions, the Hyperwarp Target Marker veers off with
;      random velocity in x and y direction, which is changed during 6% of game
;      loop iterations. Table VEERMASKTAB ($BED7) limits the maximum veer-off
;      velocity depending on the mission level:
;
;      +-----------+-----------------------------+
;      |  Mission  |      Veer-Off Velocity      |
;      +-----------+-----------------------------+
;      | NOVICE    |                   0  <KM/H> |
;      | PILOT     |  -63..-16, +16..+63  <KM/H> |
;      | WARRIOR   |  -95..-16, +16..+95  <KM/H> |
;      | COMMANDER | -127..-16, +16..+127 <KM/H> |
;      +-----------+-----------------------------+
;
; (2)  STAR TRAIL PHASE
;
;      When our starship's velocity reaches a velocity of 128 <KM/H> (the
;      VELOCITY readout of the Control Panel Display displays "50"), in addition
;      to all effects of the ACCELERATION PHASE, multiple star trails begin to
;      appear while our starship continues to accelerate. Each star trail is
;      initialized in subroutine INITTRAIL ($A9B4).
;
; (3)  HYPERSPACE PHASE
;
;      When our starship's velocity reaches a velocity of 254 <KM/H> (the
;      VELOCITY readout of the Control Panel Display displays "99") our starship
;      enters the HYPERSPACE PHASE (the VELOCITY readout of the Control Panel
;      Display displays the infinity symbol).
;
;      During the first pass of the HYPERSPACE PHASE the hyperwarp state is set
;      to HYPERSPACE. This makes the stars and the Hyperwarp Target Marker
;      disappear in GAMELOOP ($A1F3). Then, the beeper sound pattern HYPERWARP
;      TRANSIT is played in subroutine BEEP ($B3A6), the hyperwarp distance and
;      required hyperwarp energy is calculated in subroutine CALCWARP ($B1A7),
;      and the title line is preloaded with "HYPERSPACE". Code execution returns
;      via calling subroutine CLEANUPWARP ($A98D) where program variables are
;      already initialized to their post-hyperwarp values.
;
;      During subsequent passes of the HYPERSPACE PHASE, the calculated
;      hyperwarp energy is decremented in chunks of 10 energy units. Code
;      execution returns via calling subroutine DECENERGY ($B86F), which
;      decrements our starship's energy. After the calculated hyperwarp energy
;      is spent the DECELERATION PHASE is entered.
;
; (4)  DECELERATION PHASE
;
;      The title line flashes "HYPERWARP COMPLETE", the star field reappears and
;      our starship decelerates to a stop. The Engines and the hyperwarp are
;      disengaged and stopped in subroutine ENDWARP ($A987), the arrival
;      coordinates on the Galactic Chart are initialized, as well as the
;      vicinity mask.
;
;      The vicinity mask limits the position vector components (coordinates) of
;      space objects in the arrival sector relative to our starship. The
;      vicinity mask is picked from table VICINITYMASKTAB ($BFB3) by an index
;      calculated by the arrival y-coordinate modulo 8: The more you have placed
;      the arrival hyperwarp marker in the vertical center of a sector on the
;      Galactic Chart, the closer space objects in this sector will be to our
;      starship. For example, if you placed the arrival hyperwarp marker exactly
;      in the vertical middle of the sector the index will be 3, thus the space
;      objects inside the arrival sector will be in the vicinity of <= 4095 <KM>
;      of our starship. The following table lists the possible coordinates
;      depending on the calculated index:
;
;      +-------+-----------------------+
;      | Index |    ABS(Coordinate)    |
;      +-------+-----------------------+
;      |   0   | <= 65535 ($FF**) <KM> |
;      |   1   | <= 65535 ($FF**) <KM> |
;      |   2   | <= 16383 ($3F**) <KM> |
;      |   3   | <=  4095 ($0F**) <KM> |
;      |   4   | <= 16383 ($3F**) <KM> |
;      |   5   | <= 32767 ($7F**) <KM> |
;      |   6   | <= 65535 ($FF**) <KM> |
;      |   7   | <= 65535 ($FF**) <KM> |
;      +-------+-----------------------+
;
;      If there is a starbase in the arrival sector, its x and y coordinates are
;      initialized to random values within the interval defined by the vicinity
;      mask by using subroutine RNDINVXY ($B7BE). Its z-coordinate is forced to
;      a value >= +$71** (+28928) <KM>. Its velocity vector components are set
;      to 0 <KM/H>. 
;
;      If there are Zylon ships in the arrival sector then a red alert is
;      initialized by setting the red alert lifetime to 255 game loop
;      iterations, playing the beeper sound pattern RED ALERT in subroutine BEEP
;      ($B3A6) and setting the title phrase to "RED ALERT".

; DESCRIPTION
;
; BACKGROUND
;
; Star trails are displayed during the STAR TRAIL PHASE, that is, after the
; ACCELERATION PHASE and before the HYPERSPACE PHASE of the hyperwarp. 
;
; A star trail is formed by 6 stars represented by 6 PLAYFIELD space objects
; with continuous position vector indices in 17..48 (indices are wrapped around
; when greater than 48). Between the creation of two star trails there is delay
; of 4 game loop iterations.
;
; DETAILS
;
; This subroutine first decrements this star trail creation delay, returning if
; the delay is still counting down. If the delay falls below 0 then it continues
; accelerating our starship's velocity toward hyperwarp speed and then creates a
; new star trail:
;
; First, it raises the maximum index of used space objects to 48 (increasing the
; number of displayed space objects to 49), resets the star trail creation delay
; to 4 game loop iterations, then forms a new star trail of 6 stars represented
; by 6 PLAYFIELD space objects. The x and y coordinates for all 6 stars are the
; same, picked randomly from tables WARPSTARXTAB ($BB3A) and WARPSTARYTAB
; ($BB3E), respectively, with their signs changed randomly. Their z-coordinates
; are computed in increasing depth from at least +4608 (+$12**) <KM> in
; intervals of +80 (+$0050) <KM>. Their velocity vector components are set to 0
; <KM/H>.

; DESCRIPTION
;
; This subroutine maneuvers both of our starship's photon torpedoes, the single
; Zylon photon torpedo, and the one or two Zylon ships that are simultaneously
; displayed on the screen. It also creates meteors and new Zylon ships. This
; subroutine is executed only if our starship is not in a starbase sector and
; hyperwarp is not engaged.
;
; BACKGROUND
;
; When a Zylon ship is initialized, a "flight pattern" is assigned to it. There
; are 3 flight patterns (0, 1, and 4) which are picked from table ZYLONFLPATTAB
; ($BF91).
;
; The flight pattern determines the maximum velocity with which a Zylon ship can
; move along each axis of the 3D coordinate system, that is the maximum value of
; a velocity vector component. Velocity vector components for Zylon ships are
; picked from the Zylon velocity table ZYLONVELTAB ($BF99):
;
; +-----------------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
; | Velocity Index  |  0  |  1  |  2  |  3  |  4  |  5  |  6  |  7  |
; +-----------------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
; | Velocity <KM/H> | +62 | +30 | +16 |  +8 |  +4 |  +2 |  +1 |  0  |
; +-----------------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
; +-----------------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
; | Velocity Index  |  8  |  9  |  10 |  11 |  12 |  13 |  14 |  15 |
; +-----------------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
; | Velocity <KM/H> |  0  |  -1 |  -2 |  -4 |  -8 | -16 | -30 | -62 |
; +-----------------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
;
; The index into the Zylon velocity table ZYLONVELTAB ($BF99) corresponding to
; the maximum velocity is called the "maximum velocity index". The following
; table shows the flight patterns, their maximum velocity indices, and their
; corresponding velocities:
;
; +----------------+------------------+------------------+
; | Flight Pattern | Maximum Velocity | Maximum Velocity |
; |                |      Index       |                  |
; +----------------+------------------+------------------+
; |       0        |         0        |    +62 <KM/H>    |
; |       0        |        15        |    -62 <KM/H>    |
; |       1        |         1        |    +30 <KM/H>    |
; |       1        |        14        |    -30 <KM/H>    |
; |       4        |         4        |     +4 <KM/H>    |
; |       4        |        11        |     -4 <KM/H>    |
; +----------------+------------------+------------------+
;
; Because flight pattern 0 produces the fastest-moving Zylon ships, which
; maneuver aggressively, it is called the "attack flight pattern".
;
; Each Zylon ship has a set of 3 maximum velocity indices, one for each of its
; velocity vector components.
;
; Each Zylon ship has also one more set of 3 velocity indices, called "Zylon
; velocity indices", one for each of its velocity vector components. They are
; used to pick the current values of the velocity vector components from the
; Zylon velocity table ZYLONVELTAB ($BF99).
;
; In order to maneuver Zylon ships this subroutine uses the concept of
; "milestone velocity indices". By using delay timers, called "Zylon timers",
; this subroutine gradually increases or decreases the Zylon velocity indices
; with every game loop iteration to eventually match the corresponding milestone
; velocity indices. By incrementing a Zylon velocity index a Zylon ship
; accelerates toward the negative direction of a coordinate axis. By
; decrementing a Zylon velocity index a Zylon ship accelerates toward the
; positive direction of a coordinate axis. If one milestone velocity index is
; matched or a "milestone timer" has counted down to 0, a new milestone velocity
; index is calculated and the matching of the current Zylon velocity indices
; with the new milestone velocity indices repeats.
;
; DETAILS
;
; For quick lookup, the following table lists the PLAYERs and what space objects
; they represent in this subroutine:
;
; +--------+---------------------------------+
; | PLAYER |           Represents            |
; +--------+---------------------------------+
; |    0   | Zylon Ship 0                    |
; |    1   | Zylon Ship 1                    |
; |    2   | Zylon Photon Torpedo, Meteor    |
; |    3   | Our starship's Photon Torpedo 0 |
; |    4   | Our starship's Photon Torpedo 1 |
; +--------+---------------------------------+
;
; This subroutine executes the following steps:
;
; (1)  Update the x and y velocity vector components of both of our starship's
;      photon torpedoes 0 and 1.
;
;      The x and y velocity vector components of both of our starship's photon
;      torpedoes 0 and 1 are only updated if they are tracking (homing in on) a
;      target.
;
;      To update the y-velocity vector components of both of our starship's
;      photon torpedoes 0 and 1 the PLAYER row number difference between the
;      PLAYER of tracked target space object and the current location of the
;      PLAYER of our starship's photon torpedo 0 is passed to subroutine
;      HOMINGVEL ($AECA). It returns the new y-velocity vector component value
;      for both of our starship's photon torpedoes in <KM/H>. If the target is
;      located below our starship's photon torpedo 0 a value of 0 <KM/H> is
;      used.
;
;      NOTE: The new y-velocity vector components depend only on the PLAYER row
;      number of our starship's photon torpedo 0.
;
;      To update the x-velocity vector components of both of our starship's
;      photon torpedoes, the above calculation is repeated for the PLAYER column
;      numbers of each of our starship's photon torpedoes 0 and 1.
;
; (2)  Make the Zylon ships follow the rotation of our starship.
;
;      If you rotate our starship away from Zylon ships they adjust their course
;      such that they reappear in our starship's view.
;
;      This is achieved by 4 Zylon timers, one for each of both Zylon ships'
;      current x and y Zylon velocity indices. The Zylon timers are decremented
;      every game loop iteration. If any of them reach a value of 0, the
;      corresponding Zylon velocity index is incremented or decremented
;      depending on the current joystick position.
;
;      For example, if the Zylon timer for the x-velocity of Zylon ship 0
;      reaches 0 and at the same time the joystick is pushed left then the
;      x-Zylon velocity index of this Zylon ship is incremented. This
;      accelerates the Zylon ship toward negative x-direction ("left"): The
;      Zylon ship follows our starship's rotation. This works in Aft view, too,
;      where the direction of change of the Zylon velocity index is reversed.
;      After setting the new Zylon velocity index, it is used to pick a new
;      Zylon timer value for this Zylon velocity index: 
;
;      +--------------------------------+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
;      | Velocity Index                 |  0 |  1 |  2 |  3 |  4 |  5 |  6 |  7 |
;      +--------------------------------+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
;      | Zylon Timer Value (Game Loops) |  0 |  2 |  4 |  6 |  8 | 10 | 12 | 14 |
;      +--------------------------------+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
;      +--------------------------------+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
;      | Velocity Index                 |  8 |  9 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 |
;      +--------------------------------+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
;      | Zylon Timer Value (Game Loops) | 14 | 12 | 10 |  8 |  6 |  4 |  2 |  0 |
;      +--------------------------------+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
;
; (3)  Update the x and y velocity vector components of the single Zylon photon
;      torpedo.
;
;      If a Zylon photon torpedo is moving toward our starship then update its x
;      and y velocity vector components. They are picked from table
;      ZYLONHOMVELTAB ($BF85) and depend on the mission level. The signs of the
;      velocity vector components are always set such that the Zylon photon
;      torpedo is guided toward our starship. 
;
; (4)  Create a meteor?
;
;      If PLAYER2, the PLAYER to represent a meteor, is either initial or not
;      alive, then attempt in 7 out of 8 game loop iterations to create a new
;      meteor. 
;
;      With a probability of 2% (4:256) a new meteor is created: Its shape type
;      is set to METEOR, its position vector components to random coordinates in
;      subroutine INITPOSVEC ($B764), its lifetime to 60 game loop iterations,
;      and its velocity vector components (velocities) to x-velocity: 0 <KM/H>,
;      y-velocity: 0 <KM/H>, z-velocity: -8 <KM/H>. Then code execution returns.
;
; (5)  Toggle Zylon ship control.
;
;      Every other game loop iteration, the program takes control of and
;      maneuvers the other Zylon ship.
;
; (6)  Create new Zylon ship?
;
;      If the program-controlled Zylon ship is not alive, check if both Zylon
;      ships are not alive and this is an empty sector. If so, then attempt to
;      create a meteor. Otherwise create a new Zylon ship with infinite
;      lifetime. Randomly pick its shape type from table ZYLONSHAPTAB ($BF89)
;      (BASESTAR, ZYLON CRUISER, or ZYLON FIGHTER) and its flight pattern from
;      table ZYLONFLPATTAB ($BF91) (attack flight pattern 0 is always picked in
;      a NOVICE mission). Then set the milestone timer to 1 game loop iteration
;      and the position vector of the Zylon ship to a position of at least
;      +28928 (+$71**) <KM> in front of our starship. The y-coordinate depends
;      on the value of VICINITYMASK ($C7). The x-coordinate is the sum of the
;      y-coordinate plus at least 4864..5119 ($13**) <KM>. Randomly choose the
;      signs of the x and y coordinates.
;
; (7)  Set the current flight pattern to attack flight pattern?
;
;      The current flight pattern of the Zylon ship will change to attack flight
;      pattern if it is close enough (z-coordinate < +8192 (+$20**) <KM>) and
;      one of the following conditions is met:
;
;      o   The Zylon ship is located behind our starship.
;
;      o   The shape of the Zylon ship is not initial and does not currently
;          appear as a blip in the Long-Range Scan view.
;
; (8)  Update the back-attack flag and the milestone velocity indices.
;
;      The milestone timer is decremented for the program-controlled Zylon ship.
;      If this timer reaches a value of 0 the following steps are executed:
;
;      o   The milestone timer is reset to a value of 120 game loop iterations.
;
;      o   The back-attack flag is updated. It determines if the
;          program-controlled Zylon ship not only attacks from the front of our
;          starship but also from the back. A back-attack takes place with a
;          probability of 19% (48:256) in WARRIOR or COMMANDER missions.
;
;      o   Course corrections are prepared for the program-controlled Zylon ship
;          by computing the new milestone vector indices, resulting in new
;          velocity vector components for this Zylon ship. The new milestone
;          velocity indices for each velocity vector component are randomly
;          chosen depending of the flight pattern. Recall that the Zylon
;          velocity index is changed gradually to match the milestone velocity
;          index. It corresponds to a maximum velocity vector component when
;          using this index to pick a velocity vector component from Zylon
;          velocity table ZYLONVELTAB ($BF99):
;
;          +----------------+----------------+------------------+
;          | Flight Pattern | New Milestone  | Maximum Velocity |
;          |                | Velocity Index | Vector Component |
;          +----------------+----------------+------------------+
;          |       0        |        0       |    +62 <KM/H>    |
;          |       0        |       15       |    -62 <KM/H>    |

;
; (9)  Update milestone velocity indices in attack flight pattern.
;
;      If a Zylon ship executes the attack flight pattern, its milestone
;      velocity indices are changed depending on the current location of the
;      Zylon ship as follows:
;
;      +--------------+-------------+----------------+------------+----------------+
;      | x-Coordinate |  Where on   |   Milestone    |  Velocity  | Zylon Ship     |
;      |              |   Screen    | Velocity Index |            | Accelerates... |
;      +--------------+-------------+----------------+------------+----------------+
;      | x <  0 <KM>  | left half   |       0        | +62 <KM/H> | to the right   |
;      | x >= 0 <KM>  | right half  |      15        | -62 <KM/H> | to the left    |
;      +--------------+-------------+----------------+------------+----------------+
;      +--------------+-------------+----------------+------------+----------------+
;      | y-Coordinate |  Where on   |   Milestone    |  Velocity  | Zylon Ship     |
;      |              |   Screen    | Velocity Index |            | Accelerates... |
;      +--------------+-------------+----------------+------------+----------------+
;      | y <  0 <KM>  | bottom half |       0        | +62 <KM/H> | up             |
;      | y >= 0 <KM>  | top half    |      15        | -62 <KM/H> | down           |
;      +--------------+-------------+----------------+------------+----------------+
;
;      Thus, with respect to its x and y coordinates, the Zylon ship oscillates
;      around the center of the Front or Aft view.
;
;      This is the behavior of the Zylon ship along the z-axis:
;
;      If the Zylon ship attacks from the front:
;
;      +--------------------------+----------------+------------+----------------+
;      |       z-Coordinate       |   Milestone    |  Velocity  | Zylon Ship     |
;      |                          | Velocity Index |            | Accelerates... |
;      +--------------------------+----------------+------------+----------------+
;      | z <  +2560 (+$0A00) <KM> |       0        | +62 <KM/H> | outbound       |
;      | z >= +2560 (+$0A00) <KM> |      15        | -62 <KM/H> | inbound        |
;      +--------------------------+----------------+------------+----------------+
;
;      In other words, the Zylon ship accelerates into positive z-direction
;      (outbound) up to a distance of +2560 (+$0A00) <KM>, then reverses its
;      course and returns back to our starship (inbound).
;
;      If the Zylon ship attacks from the back:
;
;      +--------------------------+----------------+------------+----------------+
;      |       z-Coordinate       |   Milestone    |  Velocity  | Zylon Ship     |
;      |                          | Velocity Index |            | Accelerates... |
;      +--------------------------+----------------+------------+----------------+
;      | z <  -2816 (-$F500) <KM> |       0        | +62 <KM/H> | inbound        |
;      | z >= -2816 (-$F500) <KM> |      15        | -62 <KM/H> | outbound       |
;      +--------------------------+----------------+------------+----------------+
;
;      In other words, the Zylon ship accelerates into negative z-direction
;      (outbound) up to a distance of -2816 (-$(0B00)) <KM>, then reverses its
;      course and returns back to our starship (inbound).
;
; (10) Change Zylon velocity index toward milestone velocity index.
;
;      Compare all 3 Zylon velocity indices of the program-controlled Zylon ship
;      with their corresponding milestone velocity indices. Increment or
;      decrement the former to better match the latter. Use the new Zylon
;      velocity indices to pick the current velocity values from Zylon velocity
;      table ZYLONVELTAB ($BF99). 
;
; (11) Launch a Zylon photon torpedo?
;
;      Prepare launching a Zylon photon torpedo if either of the following
;      conditions are met:
;
;      o   PLAYER2 is not used as a photon torpedo
;
;      o   The y-coordinate of the Zylon ship is in the range of -768..+767
;          (-$0300..+$2FF) <KM>. 
;
;      or if
;
;      o   The Zylon photon torpedo is not alive
;
;      o   The corresponding Zylon photon torpedo delay timer has reached a
;          value of 0
;
;      o   The y-coordinate of the Zylon ship is in the range of -768..+767
;          (-$0300..+$2FF) <KM>. 
;
;      At this point the z-velocity vector component of the Zylon photon torpedo
;      is preloaded with a value of -80 or +80 <KM/H> depending on the Zylon
;      ship being in front or behind of our starship, respectively. 
;
;      Launch a Zylon photon torpedo if both of the following conditions are
;      met:
;
;      o   The Zylon ship is in front or behind of our starship, with the
;          exception of a Zylon ship behind our starship in a NOVICE mission
;          (our starship will never be shot in the back in a NOVICE mission).
;
;      o   The z-coordinate of the Zylon ship (no matter if in front or behind
;          our starship) is closer than 8192 ($20**) <KM>.
;
;      Finally, the Zylon photon torpedo is launched with a lifetime of 62 game
;      loop iterations. Its position vector is copied from the launching Zylon
;      ship in subroutine COPYPOSVEC ($ACAF). In addition, the Zylon ship is
;      earmarked for the tracking computer.

; DESCRIPTION
;
; Initializes the explosion's lifetime, the explosion fragments' position and
; velocity vectors as well as their pixel row and column numbers.
;
; An explosion has a lifetime of 128 game loop iterations. It consists of 32
; explosion fragment space objects with indices 17..48. The position vector of
; each explosion fragment is copied from the exploding PLAYER space object.
;
; The pixel column number of each explosion fragment is initialized to
;
;     PIXEL COLUMN NUMBER := PLAYER column number - 48 + RND(0..15)
;
; To convert PLAYER column numbers (in Player/Missile (PM) pixels) into pixel
; column numbers, the PLAYER column number of the left PLAYFIELD border (= 48)
; is subtracted and a random number is added.
;
; BUG (at $AC76): The added random number should not be in 0..15 but in 0..7
; because the exploding PLAYER is 8 pixels wide. The PLAYER column number
; represents the left edge of the PLAYER shape. When using a random number in
; 0..15, half of the pixels are located off to the right of the PLAYER, outside
; the PLAYER area. Suggested fix: Replace instruction AND #$0F with AND #$07. 
;
; The pixel row number of each explosion fragment is initialized to
;
;     PIXEL ROW NUMBER := (PLAYER row number - RND(0..15)) / 2 - 16
;
; BUG (at $AC88): To convert PLAYER row numbers (in PM pixels) into pixel row
; numbers, the PLAYER row number to the top PLAYFIELD border (= 16) should be
; subtracted first, then the division by 2 (instruction LRS A) should be applied
; to reduce the double-line PM resolution to the single-line PLAYFIELD
; resolution. Suggested fix: Swap instruction LRS A with SBC #16 which leads to
; the following formula for the pixel row number:
;
;     PIXEL ROW NUMBER := (PLAYER row number - 16 + RND(0..15)) / 2
;
; Incidentally, adding a random number in 0..15 is correct. PLAYER row number
; represents the top edge of the PLAYER shape, which is typically 16 PM pixels
; tall when representing a close space object.
;
; The velocity vector of explosion fragments is set to random x, y, and z
; velocity vector components in -7..+7 <KM/H>.
;
; INPUT
;
;   Y = PLAYER index from which the explosion originates. Used values are:
;     0 -> Explosion of PLAYER0 (Zylon ship 0)
;     1 -> Explosion of PLAYER1 (Zylon ship 1)
;     2 -> Explosion of PLAYER2 (Zylon photon torpedo, starbase, or meteor)

; DESCRIPTION
;
; Handles docking at a starbase, launching and returning the transfer vessel,
; and repairing our starship's subsystems. 
;
; This subroutine changes, if in Front view, the PLAYER-PLAYFIELD priority such
; that PLAYERs like the starbase appear behind the cross hairs, which are part
; of the PLAYFIELD.
;
; BUG (at $ACEE): The starbase also appears behind the stars, which are also
; part of the PLAYFIELD - a rarely noticed glitch. In Aft view, the arrangement
; is reversed: PLAYERs are arranged in front of the PLAYFIELD. Then the starbase
; (and the transfer vessel) appear in front of the cross hairs! Suggested fix:
; None, technically not possible.
;
; The starbase is tracked and the PLAYER0..2 shape types are set to STARBASE
; RIGHT, STARBASE LEFT, and STARBASE CENTER, respectively, combining them into a
; 3-part starbase shape. 
;
; If this sector is still marked as a starbase sector but no more so on the
; Galactic Chart (if in the meantime either Zylon units have surrounded this
; sector and destroyed the starbase or you have destroyed the starbase with a
; photon torpedo) then the noise sound pattern SHIELD EXPLOSION is played in
; subroutine NOISE ($AEA8) and code execution returns.
;
; Otherwise a minimum distance to the starbase of +32 (+$0020) <KM> is enforced
; and the conditions for a successful docking are checked:
;
; DOCKING CONDITIONS
;
; A docking is successful if all of the following conditions are met:
;
; (1)  The PLAYER2 (STARBASE CENTER) column number is in 120..135. 
;
;      BUG (at $AD39): At first glance, the PLAYER column interval of 120..135
;      corresponds to an almost symmetric interval of -8..+7 PM pixels relative
;      to the horizontal center of the PLAYFIELD, at PLAYER column number 128
;      (48 PM pixels offset to left PLAYFIELD border + 80 PM pixels to the
;      PLAYFIELD center). This is correct only if the PLAYER column number were
;      to designate the horizontal center of the PLAYER. However it designates
;      its left edge! Thus the used pixel column number range 120..135 creates
;      an asymmetric horizontal docking position: A docking is successful if the
;      horizontal position of the starbase shape's center is roughly -5..+10 PM
;      pixels relative to the horizontal center of the PLAYFIELD. Suggested fix:
;      Replace SBC #120 with SBC #117. This leads to an interval of -8..+7
;      pixels relative to the horizontal center of the PLAYFIELD and better
;      symmetry in the horizontal docking position.
;
; (2)  The PLAYER2 (STARBASE CENTER) row number is in 104..119.
;
;      BUG (at $AD43): The PLAYER row interval of 104..119 corresponds to an
;      asymmetric interval of -20..-5 PM pixels relative to the vertical center
;      of the PLAYFIELD, at pixel row number 80 or PLAYER row number 124. It
;      lets you dock at a starbase that "sits" on top of the horizontal cross
;      hairs but not at one that "hangs" from them. Suggested fix: Replace SBC
;      #104 with SBC #108. This leads to an interval of -8..+7 pixels relative
;      to the vertical center of the PLAYFIELD (assuming a PLAYER2 shape of 16
;      pixel height, which is typical during docking) and better symmetry in the
;      vertical docking position. 
;
; (3)  The starbase is in correct distance in front of our starship: The
;      starbase's z-coordinate must be < +512 (+$02**) <KM>.
;
; (4)  Our starship is horizontally level with the starbase: The starbase's
;      y-coordinate must be < +256 (+$01**) <KM>.
;
; (5)  Our starship is at a complete halt.
;
; DOCKING SUCCESSFUL
;
; If the conditions for a successful docking are met, the subsequent docking and
; transfer operation can be divided in the following states, starting with state
; NOT DOCKED:
;
; (1)  NOT DOCKED 
;
;      The docking state is set to ORBIT ESTABLISHED and the title line is
;      updated with "ORBIT ESTABLISHED".
;
; (2)  ORBIT ESTABLISHED 
;
;      After waiting until the title line "ORBIT ESTABLISHED" has disappeared,
;      the transfer vessel is initialized and launched: The PLAYER4 shape type
;      is set to TRANSFER VESSEL. Its position vector is set to a position above
;      and in front of our starship, but behind the starbase:
;
;          x-coordinate :=     +0..+255 (+$00**) <KM>
;          y-coordinate :=   +256..+511 (+$01**) <KM> 
;          z-coordinate := +4096..+4351 (+$10**) <KM>
;
;      Its velocity vector is set to
;
;          x-velocity   := +1 <KM/H> 
;          y-velocity   := -1 <KM/H> 
;          z-velocity   := -7 <KM/H>
;
;      This will move the transfer vessel from behind the starbase into a
;      direction toward and a little to the lower right of our starship. The
;      lifetime of the transfer vessel (and its return journey) is set to 129
;      game loop iterations. Finally, the docking state is set to RETURN
;      TRANSFER VESSEL.
;
; (3)  RETURN TRANSFER VESSEL 
;
;      After checking if the transfer vessel has passed behind our starship, the
;      beeper sound pattern ACKNOWLEDGE is played in subroutine BEEP ($B3A6),
;      the title line is updated with "TRANSFER COMPLETE", our starship's
;      subsystems are repaired, and our starship's ENERGY readout is restored to
;      9999 energy units. by inverting the z-velocity the velocity vector of the
;      transfer vessel is changed to
;
;          x-velocity   := +1 <KM/H> 
;          y-velocity   := -1 <KM/H> 
;          z-velocity   := +7 <KM/H>
;
;      thus launching the transfer vessel on its return journey to the starbase.
;      The docking state is set to TRANSFER COMPLETE. Finally, the screen is
;      updated in subroutine UPDSCREEN ($B07B).
;
; (4)  TRANSFER COMPLETE 
;
;      This docking state marks the end of a successful docking and transfer
;      operation.
;
; DOCKING ABORTED
;
; If the docking conditions above are not met and the docking state is already
; ORBIT ESTABLISHED or RETURN TRANSFER VESSEL then the message "DOCKING ABORTED"
; is displayed and the docking state is set to NOT DOCKED.

; DESCRIPTION
;
; This subroutine handles the joystick trigger and launches one of our
; starship's photon torpedo. If a target is in full lock-on then a second photon
; torpedo is prepared for automatic launch in the next game loop iteration.
;
; DETAILS
;
; If the trigger is pressed then reset the idle counter and, if not in
; hyperwarp, launch a photon torpedo with the following steps:
;
; (1)  If the trigger was pressed in this game loop iteration, a photon torpedo
;      will be launched if a previously launched photon torpedo is already under
;      way for at least 255 - 232 = 23 game loop iterations. This avoids firing
;      photon torpedoes too rapidly. 
;
; (2)  Start tracking a space object. If it is in full lock-on, set up the
;      lock-on timer, activate photon torpedo tracking, and tweak the last saved
;      trigger state such that our other photon torpedo (if available) is
;      launched automatically in the next game loop iteration.
;
; (3)  If the Photon Torpedoes are destroyed, do nothing.
;
; (4)  If the Photon Torpedoes are damaged, launch a photon torpedo from the
;      same barrel than the previous one. 
;
; (5)  If the Photon Torpedoes are not damaged, launch a photon torpedo from the
;      other barrel. 
;
; (6)  Set the lifetime of our starship's photon torpedo to infinite, set the
;      PLAYER shape to PHOTON TORPEDO. 
;
; (7)  Initialize the position vector of our starship's photon torpedo to:
;
;          x-coordinate := +256 (+$0100) <KM> (Right barrel)
;                          -256 (-$FF00) <KM> (Left barrel)
;          y-coordinate := -256 (-$FF00) <KM>
;          z-coordinate :=   +1 (+$0001) <KM>
;
; (8)  Initialize the velocity vector of our starship's photon torpedo to:
;
;          x-velocity   :=   +0 <KM/H>
;          y-velocity   :=   +0 <KM/H>
;          z-velocity   := +102 <KM/H> (All views but Aft view)
;                          -102 <KM/H> (Aft view)
;
; (9)  Subtract 10 energy units for launching our starship's photon torpedo.
;
; (10) Play the noise sound pattern PHOTON TORPEDO LAUNCHED by continuing code
;      execution into subroutine NOISE ($AEA8).

; AUDCTL ($D208) and AUDF3 ($D204). The noise sound pattern is automatically
; played in subroutine SOUND ($B2AB).
;
; NOTE: the first 8 bytes of each pattern in table NOISEPATTAB ($BF20) are
; copied in reverse order from memory. See subroutine SOUND ($B2AB) for details
; on the noise sound patterns stored in NOISEPATTAB ($BF20).

;
; Calculates the x (or y) velocity vector component of our starship's photon
; torpedo 0 or 1 when it is tracking (homing in on) a target space object.
;
; Our starship's photon torpedo's x (or y) velocity vector component depends on
; the PLAYER column (or row) number difference between the target PLAYER and our
; starship's photon torpedo PLAYER in Player/Missile (PM) pixels. This
; difference is used as an index to pick the new x (or y) velocity vector
; component of out starship's photon torpedo from table HOMVELTAB ($BFC9):

; DESCRIPTION
;
; Damages or destroys one of our starship's subsystems. There are 6 subsystems:
;
; (1)  Photon Torpedoes
; (2)  Engines
; (3)  Shields
; (4)  Attack Computer
; (5)  Long-Range Scan
; (6)  Subspace Radio
;
; Their status is stored and displayed in the Galactic Chart Panel Display by
; the colored letters PESCLR. The color of each letter represents the
; subsystem's status:
;
; +---------------+------------------+
; | Letter Color  | Subsystem Status |
; +---------------+------------------+
; | {LIGHT GREEN} | OK               |
; | {CORN YELLOW} | Damaged          |
; | {PINK}        | Destroyed        |
; +---------------+------------------+
;
; This subroutine first makes sure that we are not in demo mode. Then it picks a
; random value in 0..255 and the damage probability value. The latter value
; depends on the mission level and is picked from table DAMAGEPROBTAB ($BF10):
;
; +-----------+-------------------+---------------+
; |  Mission  |       Damage      |    Damage     |
; |   Level   | Probability Value |  Probability  |
; +-----------+-------------------+---------------+
; | NOVICE    |          0        |  0% (  0:256) | 
; | PILOT     |         80        | 31% ( 80:256) |
; | WARRIOR   |        180        | 70% (180:256) |
; | COMMANDER |        254        | 99% (254:256) |
; +-----------+-------------------+---------------+
;
; If the random number is lower than the damage probability value, a randomly
; picked subsystem is about to get damaged (or destroyed). There is a built-in
; upfront probability of 25% (2:8) that no subsystem gets harmed.
;
; If the picked subsystem is already destroyed then another subsystem is picked.
;
; Then the title phrase offset is picked from table DAMAGEPHRTAB ($BF14) to
; display the damaged subsystem in the title line. Next, color bits are picked
; that indicate a damaged system.
;
; If the Zylon photon torpedo's lifetime >= 30 game loop iterations the
; subsystem will not only be damaged but destroyed.
;
; NOTE: The Zylon photon torpedo lifetime decreases from 62 to 0 game loop
; iterations. With a remaining lifetime >= 30 game loop iterations it is
; considered strong enough to destroy one of our starship's subsystems. There
; are two exceptions to this rule: If the Attack Computer was picked to be
; destroyed it will be damaged only - not destroyed - if the Long-Range Scan has
; been already destroyed, and vice versa.
;
; Then the title phrase offset from table DESTROYPHRTAB ($BF1A) is picked to
; display the destroyed subsystem in the title line. Next, color bits are picked
; that indicate a destroyed system.
;
; The color of the subsystem's status letter is adjusted in the Galactic Chart
; Panel Display. Next, the title phrase describing the subsystem's status is
; enqueued for display in the title line. If the Attack Computer has been
; destroyed it is switched off and the PLAYFIELD is cleared. The title line is
; updated with the "DAMAGE CONTROL" message. Finally, the beeper sound pattern
; DAMAGE REPORT is played in subroutine BEEP ($B3A6).

; DESCRIPTION
;
; Both of our starship's photon torpedoes are checked if they have collided with
; a space object represented by PLAYER0..2, such as a Zylon ship, a Zylon photon
; torpedo, a starbase, or a meteor. 
;
; For quick lookup, the following table lists the PLAYERs and what space objects
; they represent:
;
; +--------+--------------------------------------------------+
; | PLAYER |                   Represents                     |
; +--------+--------------------------------------------------+
; |   0    | Zylon ship 0, Starbase Left                      |
; |   1    | Zylon ship 1, Starbase Right                     |
; |   2    | Zylon photon torpedo, Starbase Center, Meteor    | 
; |   3    | Our starship's photon torpedo 0                  |
; |   4    | Our starship's photon torpedo 1, Transfer Vessel |
; +--------+--------------------------------------------------+
;
; NOTE: Only space objects represented by PLAYER0..2 are checked for collisions.
; The transfer vessel of the starbase, represented by PLAYER4, is not checked
; and therefore cannot be destroyed by one of our starship's photon torpedoes.
;
; This subroutine first checks if our starship's photon torpedoes are
; represented by alive PLAYERs with PHOTON TORPEDO shape.
;
; In order to detect a collision with a space object, our starship's photon
; torpedo must compare its x, y, and z coordinates with the ones of the space
; object.
;
; Instead of comparing the x and y coordinates, however, this subroutines uses a
; much more efficient method by inspecting the Player/Missile collision
; registers, as the x and y axis of the 3D coordinate system establish the plane
; in which the TV screen lies. Each of our starship's photon torpedoes has its
; own Player/Missile collision register: PL3HIT ($82) for our starship's photon
; torpedo 0 and PL4HIT ($83) for our starship's photon torpedo 1. By inspecting
; these registers the hit space object is determined: 
;

; +-----------------+----------------+----------------+-------------------------+
;
; If the lifetime of the hit space object has already expired, then the hit is
; ignored.
;
; A collision along the z-axis happens if the z-coordinate of our starship's
; photon torpedo is close enough to the z-coordinate of the space object:
;
; The absolute value of the z-coordinate of the space object is converted into a
; range index in 0..7. This index picks a minimum and a maximum z-coordinate
; from tables HITMINZTAB ($BF7D) and HITMAXZTAB ($BF75). If the absolute value
; of the z-coordinate of our starship's photon torpedo is inside this interval,
; then our starship's photon torpedo has hit the space object. The following

; if a collision has been detected, the "age" (= initial lifetime - remaining
; lifetime) of our starship's photon torpedo is calculated. This age is used to
; delay playing the ZYLON EXPLOSION noise sound pattern but also to determine
; the strength of our starship's photon torpedo. Only photon torpedoes of an age
; < 15 game loop iterations can destroy a Zylon basestar.
;
; Some clean-up work is done before the actual explosion: The lock-on timer, our
; starship's photon torpedo lifetime, and the hit space object's PLAYER lifetime
; is set to 0. 
;
; If a meteor or a Zylon photon torpedo have been hit, then the score is not
; changed, skipping right to the explosion part. Otherwise, our starship's
; photon torpedo tracking flag is cleared and the Galactic Chart Map is updated.
; If a starbase was destroyed, then 3 points are added to the score. If a Zylon
; ship was destroyed, then 6 points are added to the score and the Zylon KILL
; COUNTER readout of the Control Panel Display is incremented. Next, the
; explosion is initialized in subroutine INITEXPL ($AC6B).
;
; NOTE: This subroutine lacks proper explosion initialization if the starbase
; was hit. The actual explosion initialization is done in subroutine DOCKING
; ($ACE6) when the code finds out that the starbase sector is no more marked as
; such in the Galactic Chart.
;
; Finally, the Galactic Chart Map is searched for a remaining Zylon unit. If
; none is found then the mission is complete and code execution continues into
; subroutine GAMEOVER2 ($B121), ending the game.

; DESCRIPTION
;
; If a keyboard code has been collected during a keyboard IRQ in the Immediate
; Interrupt Request handler IRQHNDLR ($A751), the idle counter is reset and the
; PLAYER-PLAYFIELD priority arranges the PLAYERs in front of the PLAYFIELD.
; Then, the keyboard code is compared with keyboard codes of table KEYTAB
; ($BABE). If no match is found the "WHAT'S WRONG" message is displayed in the
; title line and code execution returns.
;
; If one of the speed keys '0'..'9' has been pressed, a pending hyperwarp is
; aborted in subroutine ABORTWARP ($A980) and code execution returns. Otherwise
; the Engines drain rate is adjusted as well as the new velocity of our
; starship. If the Engines are damaged, a maximum speed is possible equivalent
; to speed key '5'.
;
; If one of our starship's view keys 'F' (Front), 'A' (Aft), 'G' (Galactic
; Chart), or 'L' (Long-Range Scan) have been pressed, the Display List is
; modified accordingly in subroutine MODDLST ($ADF1) and a new star field of 12
; stars is created with the help of subroutine INITPOSVEC ($B764). Code
; execution returns via subroutine UPDSCREEN ($B07B).
;
; If one of the 'T' (Tracking Computer), 'S' (Shields) or 'C' (Attack Computer)
; keys have been pressed, the corresponding status bits are toggled and the
; title line is updated with the corresponding title phrase. The beeper sound
; pattern ACKNOWLEDGE is played in subroutine BEEP ($B3A6). The tracking letter
; of the Control Panel Display is updated and the PLAYFIELD is cleared in
; subroutine CLRPLAYFIELD ($AE0D). If the Attack Computer is on, the Front or
; Aft view cross hairs are drawn, depending on the current view of our starship,
; via subroutine DRAWLINES ($A76F).
;
; If the 'H' (Hyperwarp) key has been pressed then the hyperwarp is engaged. Our
; starship's velocity is set to the maximum value, the Engines drain rate is
; increased to the equivalent of speed key '7'. Star trails are prepared. The
; position vector of the Hyperwarp Target Marker (PLAYER3) is set to the
; following values:
;
;     x-coordinate :=   +0 (+$0000) <KM>
;     y-coordinate := +256 (+$0100) <KM>
;     z-coordinate :=    + (+$****) <KM> (sign only)
;
; The velocity vector is set to the following values:
;
;     x-velocity   :=  (not initialized)
;     y-velocity   :=  (not initialized)
;     z-velocity   :=          +0 <KM/H>
;
; The temporary arrival hyperwarp marker column and row numbers are saved. If
; not in a NOVICE mission, the maximum veer-off velocity of the Hyperwarp Target
; Marker during hyperwarp is picked from table VEERMASKTAB ($BED7). This value
; depends on the selected hyperwarp energy (and thus on the distance to
; hyperwarp). Finally, the title line displays the "HYPERWARP ENGAGED" message.
;
; If the 'M' (Manual target selector) key has been pressed, the tracked target
; space object is swapped and the corresponding digit of the Control Panel
; Display is toggled between 0 and 1.
;
; If the 'P' (Pause) key has been pressed, an endless loop waits until the
; joystick is pushed.
;
; BUG (at $B103): The endless loop branches back one instruction too far.
; Suggested fix: Branch to instruction LDA PORTA at $B0FE.
;
; If the 'INV' (Abort mission) key has been pressed, the mission is aborted by
; setting the mission bonus offset, then displaying the "MISSION ABORTED"
; message in the title line. Code execution continues into subroutine GAMEOVER
; ($B10A).
;
; NOTE: This subroutine has two additional entry points:
;
; (1)  SETVIEW ($B045), which is used to enforce the Front view. It is entered
;      from the game loop GAMELOOP ($A1F3) and subroutines INITSTART ($A15E) and
;      DECENERGY ($B86F).
;
; (2)  UPDSCREEN ($B07B), which draws the cross hairs, the Attack Computer
;      Display and sets the tracking letter of the Control Panel Display. It is
;      entered from subroutine DOCKING ($ACE6).

; DESCRIPTION
;
; Handles game over, including calculating the scored rank and class.
;
; This subroutine has two entry points: 
;
; (1)  GAMEOVER ($B10A) is entered at the end of a failed mission (mission
;      aborted, zero energy, or starship destroyed by Zylon fire). Essentially,
;      our starship is shut down. Code execution continues into GAMEOVER2
;      ($B121) below.
;
; (2)  GAMEOVER2 ($B121) is entered at the end of a successful mission (all
;      Zylon ships destroyed). It puts the program in demo mode, enqueues the
;      corresponding game over message, and calculates the scored rank and
;      class.
;
;      The scored rank and class are based on the total score: the score
;      accumulated during the game plus a mission bonus, which depends on the
;      mission level and how the mission ended (mission complete, mission
;      aborted, or starship destroyed by Zylon fire). The mission bonus is
;      picked from table BONUSTAB ($BEDD).
;
;      The scored rank index is taken from bits B8..4 of the total score and
;      limited to values of 0..18. It indexes table RANKTAB ($BEE9) for the rank
;      string. The rank string is displayed in subroutine SETTITLE ($B223).
;
;      The scored class index is taken from bits B3..0 (for rank indices 0,
;      11..14) and computed from bits B4..1 (for rank indices 1..10 and 15..18).
;      It takes values of 0..15. It indexes table CLASSTAB ($BEFC) for the class
;      digit. The class digit is displayed in subroutine SETTITLE ($B223).
;
;      For quick lookup, the following table lists rank and class from the total
;      score. Pick the cell with the closest value <= your score then read the
;      rank and class off the left and the top of the table, respectively.
;
;      For example, a score of 90 results in a ranking of "Novice Class 4", a
;      score of 161 results in a ranking of "Pilot Class 3".

; DESCRIPTION
;
; This subroutine executes the following steps:
;
; (1)  Check if we are in Galactic Chart view and not in hyperwarp.
;
; (2)  Update the Galactic Chart in subroutine DRAWGC ($B4B9) if the Subspace
;      Radio is not damaged.
;
; (3)  Move the arrival hyperwarp marker (PLAYER4) across the Galactic Chart
;      every other game loop iteration. The current location of our starship is
;      indicated by the departure hyperwarp marker (PLAYER3).
;
; Code execution continues into subroutine CALCWARP ($B1A7) to calculate the
; required hyperwarp energy.
;
; NOTE: To calculate the horizontal position of PLAYER3..4 an offset of 61 is
; added (from left to right: 48 Player/Missile (PM) pixels to the left edge of
; the screen + 16 PM pixels to the left border of the Galactic Chart - 3 PM
; pixels relative offset of the PLAYER shape's horizontal center to its left
; edge = 61 PM pixels).
;
; NOTE: To calculate the vertical position of PLAYER3..4 an offset of 63 is
; added (from top to bottom: 8 Player/Missile (PM) pixels to the start of the
; Display List + 56 PM pixels to the first row of sectors - 1 PM pixel relative
; offset of the PLAYER shape's vertical center to its top edge (?) = 63 PM
; pixels).

; DESCRIPTION
;
; Calculates and displays the hyperwarp energy in the Galactic Chart view.
;
; This subroutine executes the following steps:
;
; (1)  Determine the arrival sector from the arrival hyperwarp marker position.
;
; (2)  If the Subspace Radio is not destroyed, update the target number digit of
;      the Galactic Chart Panel Display.
;
; (3)  Calculate the hyperwarp energy that is required to hyperwarp from the
;      departure hyperwarp marker to the arrival hyperwarp marker based on the
;      "block-distance":
;
;          DISTANCE := DELTAC + DELTAR / 2
;
;          where
;
;          DELTAC := ABS(WARPARRVCOLUMN - WARPDEPRCOLUMN)
;          DELTAR := ABS(WARPARRVROW - WARPDEPRROW)
;
;      NOTE: Dividing DELTAR by 2 is because PLAYERs at single-line resolution
;      have Player/Missile pixels that are half as high as they are wide.
;
;      The hyperwarp energy, divided by 10, is the sum of a value picked from
;      the hyperwarp energy table WARPENERGYTAB ($BADD) indexed by DISTANCE / 8)
;      plus a remainder computed from Bits B1..0 of DISTANCE. 
;
; (4)  Store the hyperwarp energy value in WARPENERGY ($91).
;
; (5)  Update the HYPERWARP ENERGY readout of the Galactic Chart Panel Display.

; DESCRIPTION
;
; Displays a title phrase in the title line. 
;
; INTRODUCTION
;
; Title phrases are picked from the title phrase table PHRASETAB ($BBAA). They
; consist of one or more phrase tokens. Each token is a byte representing a word
; in word table WORDTAB ($BC2B). Two special tokens are placeholders for the
; scored class ($FC) and scored rank ($FD) strings.
;
; A title phrase is split up into one or more title phrase segments, each
; fitting into the title line. One title phrase segment is displayed after the
; other after a delay called the "title segment lifetime".
;
; Phrase tokens, except the tokens for the scored class ($FC) and for the scored
; rank ($FD), contain the number of a word in word table WORDTAB ($BC2B) and may
; contain an end-of-segment or end-of-phrase marker bit.
;
; DETAILS
;
; The Display List is modified by subroutine MODDLST ($ADF1) to display the
; title line. Then, the title line is cleared and the words of the title phrase
; are copied into it using the passed offset into title phrase table PHRASETAB
; ($BBAA). If the offset has a value of $FF the title line is hidden in
; subroutine MODDLST ($ADF1). 
;
; INPUT
;
;   Y = Offset into title phrase table PHRASETAB ($BBAA). Used values are:
;     $FF  -> Hide title line
;     else -> Offset into title phrase table PHRASETAB ($BBAA), with explicitly
;             used values:
;
;     $01 -> "COMPUTER ON"
;     $04 -> "COMPUTER OFF"
;     $07 -> "SHIELDS ON"
;     $09 -> "SHIELDS OFF"

; DESCRIPTION
;
; This subroutine handles the sound effects. It is called every vertical blank
; phase, that is, every TICK (1/60 s on an NTSC ATARI Home Computer system, 1/50
; s on a PAL ATARI Home Computer system) from the Vertical Blank Interrupt
; handler VBIHNDLR ($A6D1).
;
; The program uses all of the available 4 audio channels: Audio channels 1, 2,
; and 3 are shared among the Engines sound effects and the "noise sound
; patterns" (explosion and photon torpedo sound effects), while audio channel 4
; is used for "beeper sound patterns" (status report sound effects). The
; following sections explain the beeper sound patterns and the noise sound
; patterns:
;
; o   BEEPER SOUND PATTERNS
;
;     There are the following beeper sound patterns:
;
;     (1)  HYPERWARP TRANSIT
;     (2)  RED ALERT
;     (3)  ACKNOWLEDGE
;     (4)  DAMAGE REPORT
;     (5)  MESSAGE FROM STARBASE
;
;     They are encoded in table BEEPPATTAB ($BF3E) in 6-byte long "beeper sound
;     patterns". 
;
;     Another table, BEEPFRQTAB ($BF5C), stores the frequencies for the tones
;     of each beeper sound pattern, terminated by a marker byte ($FF).
;
;     BUG (at $BF5C): The pattern frequencies in table BEEPFRQTAB ($BF5C) at
;     offset $00 are unused. Suggested Fix: Remove from code.
;
;     Whenever the program calls subroutine BEEP ($B3A6), that subroutine sets
;     up a beeper sound pattern for playing by copying 6 bytes from the pattern
;     table BEEPPATTAB ($BF3E) to BEEPFRQIND ($D2)..BEEPFRQSTART ($D7).
;     Subroutine SOUND ($B2AB) detects the copied beeper sound pattern and plays
;     the encoded tones and pauses.
;
;     The relevant variables for playing a beeper sound pattern are the
;     following (see also figures at BEEPPATTAB ($BF3E)):
;
;     BEEPFRQIND    ($D2)   = Running index into table BEEPFRQTAB ($BF5C)
;     BEEPREPEAT    ($D3)   = Number of times that the beeper sound pattern is
;                             repeated - 1
;     BEEPTONELIFE  ($D4)   = Lifetime of tone in TICKs - 1
;     BEEPPAUSELIFE ($D5)   = Lifetime of pause in TICKs - 1 ($FF -> No pause)
;     BEEPPRIORITY  ($D6)   = Beeper sound pattern priority. A playing beeper
;                             sound pattern is stopped if a beeper sound pattern
;                             of higher priority is about to be played. A value
;                             of 0 indicates that no beeper sound pattern is
;                             playing at the moment.
;     BEEPFRQSTART  ($D7)   = Index to first byte of the beeper sound pattern in
;                             table BEEPFRQTAB ($BF5C)
;
;     BEEPLIFE      ($D8)   = Lifetime of the current tone or pause in TICKs
;     BEEPTOGGLE    ($D9)   = Indicates that either a tone (0) or a pause (not
;                             0) is currently playing.
;
; o   NOISE SOUND PATTERNS
;
;     There are the following noise sound patterns:
;
;     (1)  PHOTON TORPEDO LAUNCHED
;     (2)  SHIELD EXPLOSION
;     (3)  ZYLON EXPLOSION
;
;     They are encoded in table NOISEPATTAB ($BF20) in 10-byte long "noise sound
;     patterns". 
;
;     Whenever the program calls subroutine NOISE ($AEA8), that subroutine  sets
;     up a noise sound pattern for being played by copying 10 bytes from the
;     pattern table NOISEPATTAB ($BF20) to NOISETORPTIM ($DA)..NOISELIFE ($E1)
;     and hardware sound registers AUDCTL ($D208) and AUDF3 ($D204).
;
;     The relevant variables for playing a noise sound pattern are the
;     following:
;
;     NOISETORPTIM  ($DA)   = Delay timer for PHOTON TORPEDO LAUNCHED noise
;                             sound pattern
;     NOISEEXPLTIM  ($DB)   = Delay timer for SHIELD EXPLOSION and ZYLON
;                             EXPLOSION noise sound patterns
;     NOISEAUDC2    ($DC)   = Audio channel 1/2 control shadow register
;     NOISEAUDC3    ($DD)   = Audio channel 3   control shadow register
;     NOISEAUDF1    ($DE)   = Audio channel 1 frequency shadow register
;     NOISEAUDF2    ($DF)   = Audio channel 2 frequency shadow register
;     NOISEFRQINC   ($E0)   = Audio channel 1/2 frequency increment
;     NOISELIFE     ($E1)   = Noise sound pattern lifetime
;
;     AUDCTL        ($D208) = POKEY: Audio control
;     AUDF3         ($D204) = POKEY: Audio channel 3 frequency audio register
;
;     There are two more variables that trigger noise effects. They are not part
;     of the noise sound pattern table:
;
;     NOISEZYLONTIM ($E2)  = Delay timer to trigger the ZYLON EXPLOSION noise
;                            sound pattern. It is set in subroutine COLLISION
;                            ($AF3D) when the impact of one of our starship's
;                            photon torpedoes with a target is imminent. The
;                            timer is decremented every TICK. When it reaches a
;                            value of 0 the ZYLON EXPLOSION noise sound pattern
;                            is played in subroutine SOUND ($B2AB). 
;     NOISEHITLIFE ($E3)   = Lifetime of the STARSHIP EXPLOSION noise when our
;                            starship was destroyed by a Zylon photon torpedo.
;                            It is set in GAMELOOP ($A1F3) to a value of 64
;                            TICKs. When it reaches a value of 0 the STARSHIP
;                            EXPLOSION noise is played in subroutine SOUND
;                            ($B2AB).
;
; SUBROUTINE DETAILS
;
; This subroutine executes the following steps:
;
; (1)  Play beeper sound pattern
;
;      The playing of a beeper sound pattern is started, continued, or stopped.
;
; (2)  Play ZYLON EXPLOSION noise sound pattern
;
;      If the explosion of a target space object is imminent (subroutine
;      COLLISION ($AF3D) has set NOISEZYLONTIM ($E2) to the number of game loop
;      iterations that will pass until our starship's photon torpedo will hit
;      the target), the timer NOISEZYLONTIM ($E2) is decremented every TICK. If
;      it reaches a value of 0, then the noise sound pattern ZYLON EXPLOSION is
;      played.
;
; (3)  Play starship's Engines sound
;
;      If the Engines are louder than the current noise sound pattern then the
;      noise sound pattern is terminated and the values for the audio channels
;      1..3 are updated: 
;
;      The velocity of our starship determines the pitch and the volume of the
;      Engines: the higher the velocity, the higher the pitch and the volume of
;      the Engines. The incremented value of VELOCITYLO ($70) is used as a "base
;      value" %abcdefgh.
;
;      Audio channels 1 and 2 are combined to a 16-bit audio channel 1/2,
;      clocked at 1.79 MHz. The inverted bits (represented by an overscore)
;      B7..0 of the base value form bits B12..5 of the 16-bit frequency value of
;      audio channel 1/2. Bits B7..4 of the base value form bits B3..0 of the
;      volume of audio channel 1/2, with noise distortion bit B7 set:
;                               ________
;      AUDF1/2 ($D202..3) := %000abcdefgh00000
;      AUDC2   ($D203)    := %1000abcd
;
;      Audio channel 3 is also clocked at 1.79 MHz. The inverted bits B7..0 of
;      the base value form bits B7..0 of the frequency value of audio channel 3.
;      Bits B6..4 of the base value form bits B3..0 of the volume of audio
;      channel 3, with noise distortion bit B7 set:
;                            ________
;      AUDF3   ($D204)    := %abcdefgh
;      AUDC3   ($D205)    := %10000bcd
;
;      Code execution returns at this point.
;
; (4)  Play ZYLON EXPLOSION or SHIELD EXPLOSION noise sound pattern
;
;      If the ZYLON EXPLOSION or SHIELD EXPLOSION noise sound pattern was set
;      up, the explosion noise timer NOISEEXPLTIM ($DB) is decremented every
;      TICK. It starts either with a value of 4 TICKs with a ZYLON EXPLOSION
;      noise sound pattern or with a value of 8 TICKs with a SHIELD EXPLOSION
;      noise sound pattern, set up in subroutine NOISE ($AEA8). If it reaches a
;      value of 0, then the shadow control register of audio channel 1/2
;      switches to "noise distortion" at maximum volume.
;
; (5)  Play PHOTON TORPEDO LAUNCHED noise sound pattern
;
;      If the PHOTON TORPEDO LAUNCHED noise sound pattern was set up, the photon
;      torpedo noise timer NOISETORPTIM ($DA) is decremented every TICK. It
;      starts with a value of 8 TICKs, set in subroutine TRIGGER ($AE29). The
;      noise distortion and volume for the shadow control register of audio
;      channel 3 is picked from table NOISETORPVOLTAB ($BFEB), the noise
;      frequency for audio channel 3 is picked from table NOISETORPFRQTAB
;      ($BFF3). If the photon torpedo noise timer reaches a value of 0, then the
;      shadow control registers of audio channel 1/2 switch to "tone distortion"
;      at maximum volume and a frequency of $0202.
;
;      NOTE: Using a real-time volume envelope stored in table NOISETORPVOLTAB
;      ($BFEB) for a launched photon torpedo results in the distinctive
;      "whooshing" photon torpedo sound.
;
; (6)  Play STARSHIP EXPLOSION noise
;
;      If our starship was hit by a Zylon photon torpedo then NOISEHITLIFE ($E3)
;      was set to 64 TICKs in routine GAMELOOP ($A1F3). While this value is
;      decremented every TICK, a random frequency value is stored to audio
;      channel 3 and the distortion bit of the shadow control register of audio
;      channel 3 is randomly toggled.
;
; (7)  Increase audio channels 1/2 frequency
;
;      The 16-bit frequency value of audio channels 1/2 (both shadow registers
;      and audio registers) is increased every TICK by an increment picked from
;      the currently playing noise sound pattern.
;
; (8)  Mute audio channels gradually
;
;      Toward the end of a noise sound pattern's lifetime all audio channels
;      gradually mute their volume every other TICK until completely silent.

; DESCRIPTION
;
; This subroutine executes the following initialization steps:
;
; (1)  Set up Display List
;
;      A Display List is created at DSPLST ($0280). It starts with 2 x 8 = 16
;      blank video lines, followed by 90 GRAPHICS7 rows. After a deliberate gap
;      in Display List instructions, which will be filled dynamically during the
;      game by calls to subroutine MODDLST ($ADF1), it ends with a Display List
;      wait-and-jump-back instruction to the start of the Display List at DSPLST
;      ($0280).
;
;      NOTE: The PLAYFIELD color table PFCOLORTAB ($BFA9) is copied to zero-page
;      table PF0COLOR ($F2) by loop jamming.
;
; (2)  Create lookup tables
;
;      The first lookup table MAPTO80 ($0DE9) maps a byte value of 0..255 to
;      0..80. This table is used to map unsigned (absolute) position vector
;      components (coordinates) to pixel (or PLAYER) row and column numbers.
;
;      NOTE: The PLAYFIELD is 160 pixels wide. Pixel column numbers relative the
;      horizontal PLAYFIELD center are in -80..79, hence the range of this
;      lookup table. Pixel row numbers relative the vertical PLAYFIELD center
;      are in -50..49, thus they also fit in the range of this lookup table.
;
;      The second lookup table MAPTOBCD99 ($0EE9) maps a byte value of 0..255 to
;      a BCD-encoded value in 00..99. This table is used to convert byte values
;      into decimal 2-digit values displayed by the THETA (in "gradons"), PHI
;      (in "gradons"), RANGE (in "centrons"), and VELOCITY (in "metrons per
;      second") readouts of the Console Panel Display.
;
;      The third and fourth lookup tables accelerate drawing of PLAYFIELD space
;      objects: In combination they contain the 16-bit start addresses of each
;      of the 100 rows of PLAYFIELD memory. The low bytes of the 16-bit
;      addresses are stored in table PFMEMROWLO ($0800). The high bytes are
;      stored in table PFMEMROWHI ($0864).
;
;      NOTE: The address increment is 40 (40 bytes = 160 pixels in GRAPHICS7
;      mode = 1 PLAYFIELD row of pixels). 
;
;      NOTE: The PLAYFIELD consists of 90 GRAPHICS7 rows when the Control Panel
;      Display is displayed at the bottom. When the Control Panel Display is not
;      displayed, for example in demo mode, the PLAYFIELD contains additional
;      GRAPHICS7 rows.  
;
; (3)  Copy Control Panel Display and Galactic Chart Panel Display texts
;
;      The texts of the Control Panel Display and the Galactic Chart Panel
;      Display are copied to their respective locations in memory by loop
;      jamming.
;
; (4)  Initialize Zylon unit movement timer
;
;      The timer that triggers the movement of Zylon units in the Galactic Chart
;      is initialized to a value of 99. See subroutine FLUSHGAMELOOP ($B4E4) for
;      more information on Zylon unit movement.
;
; (5)  Create Galactic Chart
;
;      The Galactic Chart memory map GCMEMMAP ($08C9) is initialized. It
;      represents 16 columns x 8 rows of sectors. Each sector contains one of
;      the 4 sector types stored in table SECTORTYPETAB ($BBA6) (starbase, 4
;      Zylon ships, 3 Zylon ships, and 2 or 1 Zylon ships), and empty sectors.
;      Before distributing the sector types, the initial position of our
;      starship is blocked on the Galactic Chart at sector row 4, sector column
;      8, so that it will not be inadvertently occupied while other sector types
;      are distributed. The number of each of the sector types to be distributed
;      is the mission level plus 2. While Zylon units can be placed anywhere,
;      starbases are placed neither at the borders of the Galactic Chart nor in
;      a sector adjacent to an occupied sector. 
;
;      After having initialized the Galactic Chart memory map, the top border of
;      the Galactic Chart is drawn with characters from the custom character
;      set.
;
;      Finally, the sector in which our starship is located and the arrival and
;      departure hyperwarp marker column and row numbers are initialized.
;
; (6)  Apply a final tweak
;
;      The last entry of lookup table MAPTOBCD99 ($0EE9) is tweaked to a value
;      of CCS.INF * 16 + CCS.SPC. It is used to display an infinity symbol by
;      the RANGE readout of the Control Panel Display in subroutine SHOWCOORD
;      ($B8A7).
;
; Code execution continues into subroutine DRAWGC ($B4B9), which draws the
; content of the Galactic Chart with characters from the custom character set.

; DESCRIPTION
;
; This subroutine handles at the end of a game loop iteration the following
; tasks:
;
; (1)  Increment counters COUNT256 ($76) and COUNT8 ($72).
;
; (2)  If our starship's energy has dropped below 1000 units then flash a {PINK}
;      alert that changes to {DARK GREY BLUE} and back to {PINK} every 128 game
;      loop iterations.
;
; (3)  Set the Shields color and the Control Panel background color every 8 game
;      loop iterations:
;
;      o   If the Shields are up and OK then set the Shields color to {DARK
;          GREEN} and the Control Panel background color to {DARK BLUE}.
;
;      o   If the Shields are up and damaged there is a probability of 78%
;          (200:256) that the Shield color is not changed.
;
;      o   If the Shields are down, damaged, or destroyed then set the Shields
;          color to {BLACK}.
;
;      o   If the Shields are destroyed then set the Control Panel background
;          color to {ORANGE}.
;
; (4)  Decrement the lifetime of our starship's and Zylon photon torpedoes.
;
; (5)  Decrement the lifetime of an explosion. If the explosion lifetime is less
;      than 112 game loop iterations, clear HITBADNESS ($8A) (thus the explosion
;      cannot destroy our starship). If the explosion lifetime is less than 24
;      (?) game loops decrement the number of explosion fragments. This makes
;      explosion fragments disappear gradually toward the end of an explosion.
;
; (6)  Increment every 40 game loop iterations the stardate clock of the
;      Galactic Chart Panel Display.
;
; (7)  Move Zylon units in the Galactic Chart.
;
;      Every 50 game loop iterations (or 100 game loop iterations when a
;      starbase is surrounded by Zylon units) decrement the score.
;
; Code execution continues if the program is not in demo mode with the following
; steps:
;
; (1)  Search the Galactic Chart for starbases surrounded by Zylon units.
;      Destroy any such starbase: Replace it with a 2-Zylon sector and subtract
;      18 points from the score. If the Subspace Radio was not destroyed, then
;      flash the title phrase "STARBASE DESTROYED" and play the beeper sound
;      pattern MESSAGE FROM STARBASE in subroutine BEEP ($B3A6).
;
; (2)  Every 8 game loop iterations the Zylon units decide, which starbase to
;      hunt: First, 128 randomly picked sectors are searched for a starbase. If
;      no starbase was found in this way, the sectors of the Galactic Chart are
;      scanned systematically left-to-right, top-to-bottom. If a starbase was
;      found then its sector, sector column, and sector row are saved, otherwise
;      code execution returns.
;
; (3)  Now the Zylon units converge toward the sector of the hunted starbase:
;      All sectors of the Galactic Chart are scanned. For any sector with a
;      Zylon unit that was not moved yet (its sector does not have the temporary
;      "already-moved" bit B5 set) its movement probability value is picked from
;      table MOVEPROBTAB ($BFBB):
;
;      +---------------+-------------+----------------+
;      |  Sector Type  |  Movement   |   Movement     | 
;      |               | Probability |  Probability   |
;      |               |    Value    |                |
;      +---------------+-------------+----------------+
;      | Empty sector  |       0     |   0% (  0:256) | 
;      | 1 Zylon ship  |     255     | 100% (255:256) |
;      | 2 Zylon ships |     255     | 100% (255:256) | 
;      | 3 Zylon ships |     192     |  75% (192:256) | 
;      | 4 Zylon ships |      32     |  13% ( 32:256) |
;      +---------------+-------------+----------------+
;
;      If this value is less or equal than a random number in 0..255 then the
;      Zylon unit is moved to another sector. A Zylon unit that currently
;      occupies the sector of our starship is not moved.
;
;      BUG (at $B620): The instruction to check the marker bit B5 of the sector
;      is CPY #$0A. This works, as sectors containing Zylon units that need to
;      be moved have values of 2..4, see table SECTORTYPETAB ($BBA6). Suggested
;      fix: Replace CPY #$0A with CPY #$20, which may make the code clearer.
;
; (4)  For every Zylon unit that is about to be moved, 9 distances ("block
;      distances") between the Zylon unit and the starbase are calculated by
;      tentatively moving the Zylon unit into each of its 8 adjacent sectors -
;      and by moving it not at all. The sector offsets are taken from table
;      COMPASSOFFTAB ($BFC0) which stores direction offsets in the following
;      order: NORTH, NORTHWEST, WEST, SOUTHWEST, SOUTH, SOUTHEAST, EAST,
;      NORTHEAST, CENTER. All 9 distances are stored in 9 consecutive bytes at
;      NEWZYLONDIST ($96).
;
;      NOTE: The last calculated distance is the current distance between Zylon
;      unit and starbase.
;
;      The Zylon unit moves to the first of the 8 adjacent sectors that matches
;      the following conditions: 
;
;      (1)  It is closer to the starbase than the Zylon unit's current sector.
;
;      (2)  It is located inside the Galactic Chart.
;
;      (3)  It is empty.
;
;      (4)  It is not the sector containing our starship.
;
;      If a suitable new sector was found then the Zylon unit is moved to this
;      sector, which is marked with the "already-moved" marker bit B5 in the
;      Galactic Chart memory map. This marker bit prevents a Zylon unit that has
;      been already moved from being moved again. The old Zylon unit sector is
;      cleared. 
;
;      If no suitable new sector was found then the above distance calculations
;      are repeated once again by adding 1 to the current distance between the
;      Zylon unit and the starbase. This may provoke a Zylon unit to move that
;      would not have moved in the previous set of distance calculations.
;
;      After having moved all Zylon units the sectors are stripped of the
;      "already-moved" marker bit B5.
;
; (5)  If a starbase has been surrounded then the Zylon unit movement timer is
;      reset to 99, buying our starship some time to destroy one of the
;      surrounding Zylon units. If the Subspace Radio is not destroyed, then the
;      message "STARBASE SURROUNDED" is flashed in the title line and the beeper
;      sound pattern MESSAGE FROM STARBASE is played in subroutine BEEP ($B3A6).

; DESCRIPTION
;
; This subroutine rotates a position vector component (coordinate) of a space
; object by a fixed angle around the center of the 3D coordinate system, the
; location of our starship. This is used in the Front, Aft, and Long-Range Scan
; views to rotate space objects in and out of the view. Although the code is
; deceptively short, there is some interesting math involved, so a more detailed
; discussion is in order.
;
; ROTATION MATHEMATICS
;
; The program uses a left-handed 3D coordinate system with the positive x-axis
; pointing to the right, the positive y-axis pointing up, and the positive
; z-axis pointing into flight direction.
;
; A rotation in this coordinate system around the y-axis (horizontal rotation)
; can be expressed as 
;
;     x' :=   cos(ry) * x + sin(ry) * z    (1a)
;     z' := - sin(ry) * x + cos(ry) * z    (1b)
;
; where ry is the clockwise rotation angle around the y-axis, x and z are the
; coordinates before this rotation, and the primed coordinates x' and z' the
; coordinates after this rotation. The y-coordinate is not changed by this
; rotation.
;
; A rotation in this coordinate system around the x-axis (vertical rotation) can
; be expressed as 
;
;     z' :=   cos(rx) * z + sin(rx) * y    (2a)
;     y' := - sin(rx) * z + cos(rx) * y    (2b)
;
; where rx is the clockwise rotation angle around the x-axis, z and y are the
; coordinates before this rotation, and the primed coordinates z' and y' the
; coordinates after this rotation. The x-coordinate is not changed by this
; rotation.
;
; SUBROUTINE IMPLEMENTATION OVERVIEW
;
; A single call of this subroutine is able to compute one of the four
; expressions (1a)-(2b). To compute all four expressions to get the new set of
; coordinates, this subroutine has to be called four times. This is done twice
; in pairs in GAMELOOP ($A1F3) at $A391 and $A398, and at $A3AE and $A3B5,
; respectively.
;
; The first pair of calls calculates the new x and z coordinates of a space
; object due to a horizontal (left/right) rotation of our starship around the
; y-axis following expressions (1a) and (1b).
;
; The second pair of calls calculates the new y and z coordinates of the same
; space object due to a vertical (up/down) rotation of our starship around the
; x-axis following expressions (2a) and (2b).
;
; If you look at the code, you may be wondering how this calculation is actually
; executed, as there is neither a sin() nor a cos() function call. What you'll
; actually find implemented are the following calculations:
;
;     Joystick left                        Joystick right
;     ---------------------                ---------------------
;     x :=  x      + z / 64    (3a)        x :=  x      - z / 64    (4a)
;     z := -x / 64 + z         (3b)        z :=  x / 64 + z         (4b)
;
;     Joystick down                        Joystick up
;     ---------------------                ---------------------
;     y :=  y      + z / 64    (5a)        y :=  y      - z / 64    (6a)
;     z := -y / 64 + z         (5b)        z :=  y / 64 + z         (6b)
;
; CORDIC ALGORITHM
;
; When you compare expressions (1a)-(2b) with (3a)-(6b), notice the similarity
; between the expressions if you substitute
;
;     sin(ry) -> 1 / 64, 
;     cos(ry) -> 1,
;     sin(rx) -> 1 / 64, and
;     cos(rx) -> 1.
;
; From sin(ry) = 1 / 64 and sin(rx) = 1 / 64 you can derive that the rotation
; angles ry and rx by which the space object is rotated per game loop iteration
; have a constant value of 0.89 degrees, as arcsine(1 / 64) = 0.89 degrees.
;
; What about cos(ry) and cos(rx)? The substitution does not match our derived
; angle exactly, because cos(0.89 degrees) = 0.99988 and is not exactly 1.
; However, this value is so close to 1 that substituting cos(0.89 degrees) with
; 1 is a very good approximation, simplifying calculations significantly.
;
; Another significant simplification results from the division by 64, because
; the actual division operation can be replaced with a much faster bit shift
; operation.
;
; This calculation-friendly way of computing rotations is known as the "CORDIC
; (COordinate Rotation DIgital Computer)" algorithm.
;
; MINSKY ROTATION
;
; There is one more interesting mathematical subtlety: Did you notice that
; expressions (1a)-(2b) use a new (primed) pair of variables to store the
; resulting coordinates, whereas in the implemented expressions (3a)-(6b) the
; value of the first coordinate of a coordinate pair is overwritten with its new
; value and this value is used in the subsequent calculation of the second
; coordinate? For example, when the joystick is pushed left, the first call of
; this subroutine calculates the new value of x according to expression (3a),
; overwriting the old value of x. During the second call to calculate z
; according to expression (3b), the new value of x is used instead of the old
; one. Is this to save the memory needed to temporarily store the old value of
; x? But isn't this a bug? If so, why does the rotation calculation actually
; work?
;
; Have a look at the expression pair (3a) and (3b) (the other expression pairs
; (4a)-(6b) work in a similar fashion):
;
;     x :=  x      + z / 64
;     z := -x / 64 + z
;
; With the substitution 1 / 64 -> e, we get
;
;     x :=  x     + e * z
;     z := -e * x + z
;
; Note that x is calculated first and then used in the second expression. When
; using primed coordinates for the resulting coordinates after calculating the
; two expressions we get
;
;     x' := x + e * z
;     z' := -e * x' + z = -e * (x + e * z) + z = -e * x + (1 - e^2) * z
;
; or in matrix form
;
;     |x'| := | 1       e   | * |x|
;     |z'|    |-e  (1 - e^2)|   |z|
;
; Surprisingly, this turns out to be a rotation matrix, because its determinant
; is (1 * (1 - e^2) - (e * -e)) = 1.
;
; (Incidentally, the column vectors of this matrix do not form a orthogonal
; basis, as their scalar product is 1 * e + (-e * (1 - e^2)) = -e^2.
; Orthogonality holds for e = 0 only.
;
; This kind of rotation calculation is described by Marvin Minsky in ["AIM 239
; HAKMEM", Item 149, p. 73, MIT AI Lab, February 1972] and is called "Minsky
; Rotation".
;
; SUBROUTINE IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
;
; To better understand how the implementation of this subroutine works, have
; again a look at expressions (3a)-(6b). If you rearrange the expressions a
; little their structure is always of the form
;
;     TERM1 := TERM1 SIGN TERM2 / 64
;
;     or shorter
;
;     TERM1 := TERM1 SIGN TERM3
;
;     where
;
;     TERM3 := TERM2 / 64
;     SIGN := + or -
;
; and where TERM1 and TERM2 are position vector components (coordinates). In
; fact, this is all this subroutine actually does: It simply adds (or subtracts)
; TERM2 divided by 64 to (from) TERM1. 
;
; When calling this subroutine the correct indices for the appropriate position
; vector components (coordinates) TERM1 and TERM2 are passed in the Y and X
; registers, respectively.
;
; What about SIGN between TERM1 and TERM3? Have again a look at expressions
; (3a)-(6b). To compute the two new coordinates after a rotation, the SIGN
; toggles from plus to minus and vice versa. The SIGN is initialized by
; JOYSTICKDELTA ($6D) before actually calling subroutine ROTATE ($B69B) and is
; toggled in every subsequent call of this subroutine. The initial value of SIGN
; should be positive (+) if the rotation is clockwise (the joystick is pushed
; right or up) and negative if the rotation is counter-clockwise (the joystick
; is pushed left or down), respectively. Because SIGN is always toggled you have
; to pass the already toggled value with the first call.
;
; NOTE: Unclear still are three instructions starting at address $B6AD. They
; seem to set the two least significant bits of TERM3 in a random fashion. Could
; this be some quick hack to avoid messing with exact but potentially lengthy
; two-complement's arithmetic here?

; Converts a pixel column number relative to the horizontal screen center to a

; execution returns. If it represents a PLAYER space object the PLAYER is pushed
; offscreen before code execution returns.
;
; NOTE: The horizontal screen center's pixel column number for PLAYFIELD space
; objects has a value of 80 = 160 PLAYFIELD pixels / 2. For PLAYER space objects
; it has a value of 125 Player/Missile (PM) pixels (from left to right: 128 PM

;
; NOTE: The vertical screen center's pixel row number for PLAYFIELD space
; objects has a value of 50 = 100 PLAYFIELD pixels / 2. For PLAYER space objects

;
; NOTE: If the position vector corresponding to the pixel represents a PLAYER

; has the same height as 2 PM pixels at single-line resolution.

; DESCRIPTION
;
; Initializes the position vector of a space object.
;
; This subroutine executes the following steps:
;
; (1)  Set the pixel row and column number to an offscreen value (= 99).
;
; (2)  If the position vector represents an explosion fragment space object then
;      return code execution immediately. This avoids generating new explosion
;      fragment space objects. They are separately initialized in subroutine
;      COPYPOSVEC ($ACAF), which is called from subroutine INITEXPL ($AC6B).
;
; (3)  Assign default values (see below) to the position vector components
;      (coordinates) depending on our starship's view.
;
; Code execution continues into subroutine RNDINVXY ($B7BE) where x and y
; coordinates are inverted randomly.
;
; After passing through this and the next subroutine RNDINVXY ($B7BE) the
; components of a position vector (coordinates) are assigned to one of the
; following values depending on our starship's view:

; DESCRIPTION
;
; This subroutine executes the following steps: 
;
; (1)  Accelerate or decelerate our starship, update the VELOCITY readout
;
;      If the new velocity value is different from the current one either
;      increment or decrement the current velocity value toward the new one.
;
;      If the Engines are damaged or destroyed (and hyperwarp is not engaged)
;      then store a random value (less or equal than the current velocity) as
;      the current velocity.
;
;      Display the updated velocity by the VELOCITY readout of the Control Panel
;      Display.
;
; (2)  Update THETA, PHI, and RANGE readouts
;
;      If the Attack Computer is working then display the x, y, and z
;      coordinates of the currently tracked space object as THETA, PHI, and
;      RANGE readout values of the Control Panel Display.
;
; (3)  Calculate overall energy consumption
;
;      Add the overall energy consumption per game loop iteration to the energy
;      counter. This value is given in energy subunits (256 energy subunits = 1
;      energy unit displayed by the 4-digit ENERGY readout of the Console Panel
;      Display). It is the total of the following items:
;
;      (1)  8 energy subunits if the Shields are up
;
;      (2)  2 energy subunits if the Attack Computer is on
;
;      (3)  1 energy subunit of the life support system
;
;      (4)  Our starship's Engines energy drain rate (depending on its velocity)
;
;      If there is a carryover of the energy counter then decrement the ENERGY
;      readout of the Control Panel Display by one energy unit after code
;      execution has continued into subroutine DECENERGY ($B86F).

; DESCRIPTION
;
; Displays a position vector component (coordinate) by one of the THETA, PHI, or
; RANGE readouts of the Control Panel Display.
;
; Write the sign to the Control Panel Display, then map the high byte of the
; respective coordinate (x -> THETA, y -> PHI, z -> RANGE) to a BCD-value in
; 00..99. Code execution continues into subroutine SHOWDIGITS ($B8CD) where the
; digits are actually stored in the Control Panel Display.
;
; NOTE: If the digits of either the THETA or PHI readout are to be displayed and
; the x or y position vector component (high byte) is $FF then tweak the value
; to $FE. This avoids accessing table MAPTOBCD99 ($0EE9) with an index of $FF
; that would return the special value $EA. This value represents the CCS.INF
; ($0E) and CCS.SPC ($0A) characters (see comments in subroutine INITIALIZE
; ($B3BA)) that are displayed by the RANGE readout only.
;
; INPUT
;
;   A = Position vector component (coordinate) offset. Used values are: 
;     $00 -> z-coordinate
;     $31 -> x-coordinate
;     $62 -> y-coordinate
;
;   Y = Offset into the Control Panel Display memory map. Used values are:
;     $17 -> First character (sign) of THETA readout (x-coordinate of tracked
;            space object)
;     $1D -> First character (sign) of PHI readout   (y-coordinate of tracked

; DESCRIPTION
;
; Converts a binary value in $00..$FF to a BCD-value in 0..99 and displays it as
; a 2-digit number in the Control Panel Display.
;
; INPUT
;
;   X = Value to be displayed as a 2-digit BCD-value. Used values are: $00..$FF.
;
;   Y = Offset into the Control Panel Display memory map relative to the first
;       character of the Control Panel Display (the 'V' of the VELOCITY
;       readout). Used values are: 
;     $01 -> Character before first digit of VELOCITY readout
;     $17 -> First character (sign) of THETA readout (x-coordinate of tracked
;            space object)
;     $1D -> First character (sign) of PHI readout   (y-coordinate of tracked
;            space object)
;     $23 -> First character (sign) of RANGE readout (z-coordinate of tracked
;            space object)
